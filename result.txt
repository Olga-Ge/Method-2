THE BOY WHO LIVED Bob
 Bob
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, Bob
were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, Bob
thank you very much. They were the last people you’d Bob
expect to be involved in anything strange or Bob
mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such Bob
nonsense. Bob
 Bob
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Bob
Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy Bob
man with hardly any neck, although he did have a Bob
very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and Bob
blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of Bob
neck, which came in very useful as she spent so Bob
much of her time craning over garden fences, spying Bob
on the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son Bob
called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer Bob
boy anywhere. Bob
 Bob
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they Bob
also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that Bob
somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they Bob
could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Bob
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t Bob

 Bob
met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended Bob
she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her Bob
good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it Bob
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think Bob
what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in Bob
the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a Bob
small son, too, but they had never even seen him. Bob
 Bob
This boy was another good reason for keeping the Bob
Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a Bob
child like that. Bob
 Bob
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Bob
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the Bob
cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and Bob
mysterious things would soon be happening all over Bob
the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out Bob
his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley Bob
gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Bob
Dudley into his high chair. Bob
 Bob
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past Bob
the window. Bob
 Bob
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his Bob
briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and Bob
tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Bob
Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his Bob
cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley Bob
as he left the house. He got into his car and backed Bob
out of number four’s drive. Bob
 Bob
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the Bob
first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a Bob
map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he Bob
had seen — then he jerked his head around to look Bob
again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner Bob
of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What Bob
could he have been thinking of? It must have been a Bob
trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at Bob

the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around Bob
the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his Bob
mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Bob
Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read Bob
maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake Bob
and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward Bob
town he thought of nothing except a large order of Bob
drills he was hoping to get that day. Bob
 Bob
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his Bob
mind by something else. As he sat in the usual Bob
morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that Bob
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people Bob
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear Bob
people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups Bob
you saw on young people! He supposed this was some Bob
stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the Bob
steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these Bob
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering Bob
excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see Bob
that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that Bob
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an Bob
emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it Bob
struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly Bob
stunt — these people were obviously collecting for Bob
something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved Bob
on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Bob
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Bob
 Bob
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in Bob
his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might Bob
have found it harder to concentrate on drills that Bob
morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in Bob
broad daylight, though people down in the street did; Bob
they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after Bob
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an Bob
owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a Bob
perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five Bob
different people. He made several important telephone Bob

calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good Bob
mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch Bob
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a Bob
bun from the bakery. Bob
 Bob
He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he Bob
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed Bob
them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but Bob
they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering Bob
excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting Bob
tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a Bob
large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words Bob
of what they were saying. Bob
 Bob
“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” Bob
 Bob
“ — yes, their son, Harry — ” Bob
 Bob
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He Bob
looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say Bob
something to them, but thought better of it. Bob
 Bob
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his Bob
office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, Bob
seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing Bob
his home number when he changed his mind. He put Bob
the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, Bob
thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t Bob
such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots Bob
of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Bob
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew Bob
was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It Bob
might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no Bob
point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so Bob
upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame Bob
her — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the Bob
same, those people in cloaks ... Bob
 Bob

 Bob
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that Bob
afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, Bob
he was still so worried that he walked straight into Bob
someone just outside the door. Bob
 Bob
“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled Bob
and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Bob
Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet Bob
cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost Bob
knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split Bob
into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that Bob
made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, Bob
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- Bob
Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like Bob
yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy Bob
day!” Bob
 Bob
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the Bob
middle and walked off. Bob
 Bob
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been Bob
hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he Bob
had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was Bob
rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, Bob
hoping he was imagining things, which he had never Bob
hoped before, because he didn’t approve of Bob
imagination. Bob
 Bob
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the Bob
first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — Bob
was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was Bob
now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the Bob
same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. Bob
 Bob
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly. Bob
 Bob
The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Bob
 Bob
Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Bob
Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the Bob

house. He was still determined not to mention Bob
anything to his wife. Bob
 Bob
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told Bob
him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems Bob
with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new Bob
word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. Bob
When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the Bob
living room in time to catch the last report on the Bob
evening news: Bob
 Bob
“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported Bob
that the nation’s owls have been behaving very Bob
unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at Bob
night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have Bob
been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in Bob
every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to Bob
explain why the owls have suddenly changed their Bob
sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a Bob
grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim Bob
McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more Bob
showers of owls tonight, Jim?” Bob
 Bob
“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about Bob
that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting Bob
oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, Bob
and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that Bob
instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a Bob
downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have Bob
been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until Bob
next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night Bob
tonight.” Bob
 Bob
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars Bob
all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious Bob
people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a Bob
whisper about the Potters . . . Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two Bob
cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say Bob
something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er Bob
— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister Bob
lately, have you?” Bob
 Bob
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and Bob
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t Bob
have a sister. Bob
 Bob
“No,” she said sharply. “Why?” Bob
 Bob
“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. Bob
“Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of Bob
funny-looking people in town today ...” Bob
 Bob
“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley. Bob
 Bob
“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to Bob
do with ... you know ... her crowd.” Bob
 Bob
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Bob
Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d Bob
heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. Bob
Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — Bob
he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” Bob
 Bob
“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. Bob
 Bob
“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?” Bob
 Bob
“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking Bob
horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.” Bob
 Bob
He didn’t say another word on the subject as they Bob
went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the Bob
bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
and peered down into the front garden. The cat was Bob
still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though Bob
it were waiting for something. Bob
 Bob
Was he imagining things? Could all this have Bob
anything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out Bob
that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t Bob
think he could bear it. Bob
 Bob
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep Bob
quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over Bob
in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell Bob
asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, Bob
there was no reason for them to come near him and Bob
Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Bob
Petunia thought about them and their kind. ... He Bob
couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up Bob
in anything that might be going on — he yawned and Bob
turned over — it couldn’t affect them. ... Bob
 Bob
How very wrong he was. Bob
 Bob
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy Bob
sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no Bob
sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, Bob
its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Bob
Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door Bob
slammed on the next street, nor when two owls Bob
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight Bob
before the cat moved at all. Bob
 Bob
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been Bob
watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d Bob
have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The Bob
cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Bob
 Bob
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Bob
Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the Bob
silver of his hair and beard, which were both long Bob
 Bob

 Bob
enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long Bob
robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and Bob
high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, Bob
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles Bob
and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it Bob
had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Bob
Albus Dumbledore. Bob
 Bob
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had Bob
just arrived in a street where everything from his Bob
name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy Bob
rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But Bob
he did seem to realize he was being watched, because Bob
he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still Bob
staring at him from the other end of the street. For Bob
some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse Bob
him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have Bob
known.” Bob
 Bob
He found what he was looking for in his inside Bob
pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He Bob
flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. Bob
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He Bob
clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into Bob
darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, Bob
until the only lights left on the whole street were two Bob
tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of Bob
the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their Bob
window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they Bob
wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening Bob
down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put- Bob
Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the Bob
street toward number four, where he sat down on the Bob
wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a Bob
moment he spoke to it. Bob
 Bob
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” Bob

 Bob
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Bob
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking Bob
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the Bob
shape of the markings the cat had had around its Bob
eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Bob
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She Bob
looked distinctly ruffled. Bob
 Bob
“How did you know it was me?” she asked. Bob
 Bob
“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” Bob
 Bob
“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all Bob
day,” said Professor McGonagall. Bob
 Bob
“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I Bob
must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my Bob
way here.” Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. Bob
 Bob
“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said Bob
impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, Bob
but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s Bob
going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head Bob
back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I Bob
heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, Bob
they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to Bob
notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll Bob
bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much Bob
sense.” Bob
 Bob
“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. Bob
“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven Bob
years.” Bob
 Bob
“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. Bob
 Bob
“But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are Bob
being downright careless, out on the streets in broad Bob

daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, Bob
swapping rumors.” Bob
 Bob
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore Bob
here, as though hoping he was going to tell her Bob
something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine Bob
thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who Bob
seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found Bob
out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Bob
Dumbledore?” Bob
 Bob
“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have Bob
much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon Bob
drop?” Bob
 Bob
“A what?” Bob
 Bob
“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m Bob
rather fond of.” Bob
 Bob
“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as Bob
though she didn’t think this was the moment for Bob
lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has Bob
gone — ” Bob
 Bob
“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like Bob
yourself can call him by his name? All this You- Bob
Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been Bob
trying to persuade people to call him by his proper Bob
name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Bob
Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, Bob
seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we Bob
keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any Bob
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.” Bob
 Bob
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, Bob
sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re Bob
different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You- Bob
Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort Bob
had powers I will never have.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use Bob
them.” Bob
 Bob
“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Bob
Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.” Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Bob
Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to Bob
the rumors that are flying around. You know what Bob
everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? Bob
 Bob
About what finally stopped him?” Bob
 Bob
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the Bob
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real Bob
reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all Bob
day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she Bob
fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she Bob
did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was Bob
saying, she was not going to believe it until Bob
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, Bob
however, was choosing another lemon drop and did Bob
not answer. Bob
 Bob
“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last Bob
night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He Bob
went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and Bob
James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.” Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall Bob
gasped. Bob
 Bob
“Lily and James ... I can’t believe it ... I didn’t want to Bob
believe it ... Oh, Albus ...” Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the Bob
shoulder. “I know ... I know ...” he said heavily. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went Bob
on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Bob
Potters’ son, Harry. But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t Bob
kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but Bob
they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Bob
Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why Bob
he’s gone.” Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore nodded glumly. Bob
 Bob
“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After Bob
all he’s done ... all the people he’s killed ... he couldn’t Bob
kill a little boy? It’s just astounding ... of all the Bob
things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven Bob
did Harry survive?” Bob
 Bob
“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may Bob
never know.” Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief Bob
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Bob
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden Bob
watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very Bob
odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; Bob
instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It Bob
must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, Bob
because he put it back in his pocket and said, Bob
“Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be Bob
here, by the way?” Bob
 Bob
“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t Bob
suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all Bob
places?” Bob
 Bob
“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. Bob
They’re the only family he has left now.” Bob
 Bob
“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who Bob
live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her Bob
 Bob

feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you Bob
can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t Bob
find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got Bob
this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way Bob
up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter Bob
come and live here!” Bob
 Bob
“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. Bob
“His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything Bob
to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.” Bob
 Bob
“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, Bob
sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, Bob
you think you can explain all this in a letter? These Bob
people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — Bob
a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was Bob
known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will Bob
be books written about Harry — every child in our Bob
world will know his name!” Bob
 Bob
“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously Bob
over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be Bob
enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can Bob
walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even Bob
remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, Bob
growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take Bob
it?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her Bob
mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re Bob
right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Bob
Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though Bob
she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid’s bringing him.” Bob
 Bob
“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with Bob
something as important as this?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore. Bob
 Bob
“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Bob
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t Bob
pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what Bob
was that?” Bob
 Bob
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around Bob
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and Bob
down the street for some sign of a headlight; it Bob
swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — Bob
and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed Bob
on the road in front of them. Bob
 Bob
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man Bob
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a Bob
normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked Bob
simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long Bob
tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his Bob
face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his Bob
feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In Bob
his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of Bob
blankets. Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At Bob
last. And where did you get that motorcycle?” Bob
 Bob
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the Bob
giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he Bob
spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, Bob
sir.” Bob
 Bob
“No problems, were there?” Bob
 Bob
“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him Bob
out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ Bob
around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward Bob
over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a Bob
baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair Bob
over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped Bob
cut, like a bolt of lightning. Bob
 Bob
“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall. Bob
 Bob
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Hell have that scar forever.” Bob
 Bob
“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?” Bob
 Bob
“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. Bob
 Bob
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect Bob
map of the London Underground. Well — give him Bob
here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned Bob
toward the Dursleys’ house. Bob
 Bob
“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Bob
Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry Bob
and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, Bob
whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl Bob
like a wounded dog. Bob
 Bob
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Bob
Muggles!” Bob
 Bob
“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted Bob
handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c- Bob
can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Bob
Harry off ter live with Muggles — ” Bob
 Bob
“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Bob
Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall Bob
whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Bob
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and Bob
walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the Bob

doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it Bob
inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the Bob
other two. For a full minute the three of them stood Bob
and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders Bob
shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and Bob
the twinkling light that usually shone from Bob
Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. Bob
 Bob
“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no Bob
business staying here. We may as well go and join the Bob
celebrations.” Bob
 Bob
“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best Bob
get this bike away. G ’night, Professor McGonagall — Bob
Professor Dumbledore, sir.” Bob
 Bob
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid Bob
swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the Bob
engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off Bob
into the night. Bob
 Bob
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” Bob
said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor Bob
McGonagall blew her nose in reply. Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. Bob
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put- Bob
Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light Bob
sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive Bob
glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a Bob
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end Bob
of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets Bob
on the step of number four. Bob
 Bob
“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his Bob
heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. Bob
 Bob
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which Bob
lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last Bob

place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Bob
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without Bob
waking up. One small hand closed on the letter Bob
beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was Bob
special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he Bob
would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Bob
 Bob
Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put Bob
out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next Bob
few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Bob
Dudley. ... He couldn’t know that at this very Bob
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country Bob
were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed Bob
voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” Bob

THE VANASHIG GLASS Bob
 Bob
Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had Bob
woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Bob
Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose Bob
on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass Bob
number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into Bob
their living room, which was almost exactly the same Bob
as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had Bob
seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the Bob
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how Bob
much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been Bob
lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach Bob
ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Bob
Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the Bob
photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first Bob
bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer Bob
game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his Bob
mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy Bob
lived in the house, too. Bob
 Bob
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, Bob
but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it Bob

was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the Bob
day. Bob
 Bob
“Up! Get up! Now!” Bob
 Bob
Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door Bob
again. Bob
 Bob
“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward Bob
the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan Bob
being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and Bob
tried to remember the dream he had been having. It Bob
had been a good one. There had been a flying Bob
motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the Bob
same dream before. Bob
 Bob
His aunt was back outside the door. Bob
 Bob
“Are you up yet?” she demanded. Bob
 Bob
“Nearly,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the Bob
bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want Bob
everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.” Bob
 Bob
Harry groaned. Bob
 Bob
“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the Bob
door. Bob
 Bob
“Nothing, nothing ...” Bob
 Bob
Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Bob
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for Bob
socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after Bob
pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry Bob
was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the Bob
stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the Bob
kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Bob
Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though Bob
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not Bob
to mention the second television and the racing bike. Bob
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a Bob
mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated Bob
exercise — unless of course it involved punching Bob
somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, Bob
but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, Bob
but he was very fast. Bob
 Bob
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark Bob
cupboard, but Harry had always been small and Bob
skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and Bob
skinnier than he really was because all he had to Bob
wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was Bob
about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin Bob
face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green Bob
eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot Bob
of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had Bob
punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked Bob
about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his Bob
forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He Bob
had had it as long as he could remember, and the Bob
first question he could ever remember asking his Bob
Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. Bob
 Bob
“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had Bob
said. “And don’t ask questions.” Bob
 Bob
Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a Bob
quiet life with the Dursleys. Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was Bob
turning over the bacon. Bob
 Bob
“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning Bob
greeting. Bob
 Bob

 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top Bob
of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a Bob
haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the Bob
rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made Bob
no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over Bob
the place. Bob
 Bob
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in Bob
the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Bob
Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much Bob
neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair Bob
that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia Bob
often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Bob
Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a Bob
wig. Bob
 Bob
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, Bob
which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. Bob
Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His Bob
face fell. Bob
 Bob
“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and Bob
father. “That’s two less than last year.” Bob
 Bob
“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, Bob
see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Bob
Daddy.” Bob
 Bob
“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red Bob
in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley Bob
tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as Bob
fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Bob
 Bob
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because Bob
she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two Bob
presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? Bob
Two more presents. Is that all right?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard Bob
work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty ... Bob
thirty ...” Bob
 Bob
“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia. Bob
 Bob
“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the Bob
nearest parcel. “All right then.” Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon chuckled. Bob
 Bob
“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his Bob
father. ’Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair. Bob
 Bob
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia Bob
went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon Bob
watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video Bob
camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new Bob
computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the Bob
paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came Bob
back from the telephone looking both angry and Bob
worried. Bob
 Bob
“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her Bob
leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Bob
Harry’s direction. Bob
 Bob
Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart Bob
gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his Bob
parents took him and a friend out for the day, to Bob
adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the Bob
movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Bob
Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Bob
 Bob
Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of Bob
cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs Bob
of all the cats she’d ever owned. Bob
 Bob
“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Bob
Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, Bob
but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would Bob
be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Bob
Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. Bob
 Bob
“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.” Bob
 Bob
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as Bob
though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was Bob
something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, Bob
like a slug. Bob
 Bob
“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Bob
Yvonne?” Bob
 Bob
“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia. Bob
 Bob
“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully Bob
(he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television Bob
for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s Bob
computer) . Bob
 Bob
Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a Bob
lemon. Bob
 Bob
“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she Bob
snarled. Bob
 Bob
“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they Bob
weren’t listening. Bob
 Bob
“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Bob
Petunia slowly, "... and leave him in the car. ...” Bob
 Bob
“That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. ...” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really Bob
crying — it had been years since he’d really cried — Bob
but he knew that if he screwed up his face and Bob
wailed, his mother would give him anything he Bob
wanted. Bob
 Bob
“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him Bob
spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms Bob
around him. Bob
 Bob
“I ... don’t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!” Dudley Bob
yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp- Bob
spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through Bob
the gap in his mothers arms. Bob
 Bob
Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, Bob
they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a Bob
moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, Bob
walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy Bob
with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who Bob
held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley Bob
hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Bob
 Bob
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his Bob
luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Bob
Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first Bob
time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able Bob
to think of anything else to do with him, but before Bob
they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. Bob
 Bob
“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large Bob
purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you Bob
now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — Bob
and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Bob
Christmas.” Bob
 Bob
I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
The problem was, strange things often happened Bob
around Harry and it was just no good telling the Bob
Dursleys he didn’t make them happen. Bob
 Bob
Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from Bob
the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, Bob
had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair Bob
so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, Bob
which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had Bob
laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless Bob
night imagining school the next day, where he was Bob
already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped Bob
glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to Bob
find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Bob
Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week Bob
in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to Bob
explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown Bob
back so quickly. Bob
 Bob
Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force Bob
him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown Bob
with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it Bob
over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until Bob
finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but Bob
certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided Bob
it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great Bob
relief, Harry wasn’t punished. Bob
 Bob
On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble Bob
for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Bob
Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, Bob
as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he Bob
was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had Bob
received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress Bob
telling them Harry had been climbing school Bob
buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Bob
Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his Bob

 Bob
cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans Bob
outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the Bob
wind must have caught him in mid-jump. Bob
 Bob
But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even Bob
worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the Bob
day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Bob
Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. Bob
 Bob
While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Bob
Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at Bob
work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry Bob
were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, Bob
it was motorcycles. Bob
 Bob
"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” Bob
he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. Bob
 Bob
“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, Bob
remembering suddenly. “It was flying.” Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He Bob
turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, Bob
his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: Bob
“MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!” Bob
 Bob
Dudley and Piers sniggered. Bob
 Bob
“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.” Bob
 Bob
But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was Bob
one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his Bob
asking questions, it was his talking about anything Bob
acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a Bob
dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he Bob
might get dangerous ideas. Bob
 Bob
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was Bob
crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley Bob
 Bob
Page | 28 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance Bob
and then, because the smiling lady in the van had Bob
asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry Bob
him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It Bob
wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they Bob
watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked Bob
remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond. Bob
 Bob
Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. Bob
He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Bob
Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting Bob
to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t Bob
fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They Bob
ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a Bob
tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have Bob
enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him Bob
another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Bob
 Bob
Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it Bob
was all too good to last. Bob
 Bob
After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool Bob
and dark in there, with lit windows all along the Bob
walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes Bob
were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and Bob
stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, Bob
poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Bob
Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It Bob
could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Bob
Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at Bob
the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was Bob
fast asleep. Bob
 Bob
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, Bob
staring at the glistening brown coils. Bob
 Bob
“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon Bob
tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped Bob
the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake Bob
just snoozed on. Bob
 Bob
“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Bob
 Bob
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently Bob
at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it Bob
had died of boredom itself — no company except Bob
stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass Bob
trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than Bob
having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only Bob
visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to Bob
wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the Bob
house. Bob
 Bob
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, Bob
very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a Bob
level with Harry’s. Bob
 Bob
It winked. Bob
 Bob
Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if Bob
anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back Bob
at the snake and winked, too. Bob
 Bob
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Bob
Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Bob
Harry a look that said quite plainly: Bob
 Bob
“I get that all the time.” Bob
 Bob
“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though Bob
he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be Bob
really annoying.” Bob
 Bob
The snake nodded vigorously. Bob
 Bob
“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. Bob
 Bob
Page | 30 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the Bob
glass. Harry peered at it. Bob
 Bob
Boa Constrictor, Brazil. Bob
 Bob
“Was it nice there?” Bob
 Bob
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again Bob
and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the Bob
zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” Bob
 Bob
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout Bob
behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! Bob
MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! Bob
YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” Bob
 Bob
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he Bob
could. Bob
 Bob
“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the Bob
ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the Bob
concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no Bob
one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Bob
Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the Bob
next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Bob
 Bob
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa Bob
constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was Bob
uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. Bob
People throughout the reptile house screamed and Bob
started running for the exits. Bob
 Bob
As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have Bob
sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come. Bob
... Thanksss, amigo.” Bob
 Bob
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass Bob
go?” " Bob
 Bob
The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of Bob
strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over Bob
again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Bob
Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything Bob
except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but Bob
by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Bob
Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off Bob
his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to Bob
squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at Bob
least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry Bob
was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the Bob
house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he Bob
could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go — Bob
cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed Bob
into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get Bob
him a large brandy. Bob
 Bob
Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing Bob
he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and Bob
he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Bob
 Bob
Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the Bob
kitchen for some food. Bob
 Bob
He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten Bob
miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever Bob
since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in Bob
that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car Bob
when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he Bob
strained his memory during long hours in his Bob
cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a Bob
blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his Bob
forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though Bob
he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came Bob
from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His Bob

 Bob
aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of Bob
course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were Bob
no photographs of them in the house. Bob
 Bob
When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and Bob
dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take Bob
him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys Bob
were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or Bob
maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to Bob
know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A Bob
tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once Bob
while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. Bob
After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Bob
Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without Bob
buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed Bob
all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. Bob
 Bob
A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually Bob
shaken his hand in the street the other day and then Bob
walked away without a word. The weirdest thing Bob
about all these people was the way they seemed to Bob
vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. Bob
 Bob
At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Bob
Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his Bob
baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody Bob
liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang. Bob

THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE Bob
 Bob
The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Bob
Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he Bob
was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer Bob
holidays had started and Dudley had already broken Bob
his new video camera, crashed his remote control Bob
airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, Bob
knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Bob
Drive on her crutches. Bob
 Bob
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no Bob
escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every Bob
single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were Bob
all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and Bob
stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of Bob
them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite Bob
sport: Harry Hunting. Bob
 Bob
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible Bob
out of the house, wandering around and thinking Bob
about the end of the holidays, where he could see a Bob
tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be Bob
going off to secondary school and, for the first time in Bob

his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been Bob
accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Bob
Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, Bob
on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the Bob
local public school. Dudley thought this was very Bob
funny. Bob
 Bob
“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day Bob
at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs Bob
and practice?” Bob
 Bob
“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had Bob
anything as horrible as your head down it — it might Bob
be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out Bob
what he’d said. Bob
 Bob
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London Bob
to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Bob
Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out Bob
she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and Bob
she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She Bob
let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of Bob
chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for Bob
several years. Bob
 Bob
That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room Bob
for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings Bob
boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, Bob
and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried Bob
knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the Bob
teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be Bob
good training for later life. Bob
 Bob
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Bob
Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest Bob
moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and Bob
said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, Bob
he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t Bob

There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next Bob

went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked Bob
like dirty rags swimming in gray water. Bob
 Bob
“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips Bob
tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a Bob
question. Bob
 Bob
“Your new school uniform,” she said. Bob
 Bob
Harry looked in the bowl again. Bob
 Bob
“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing Bob
some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just Bob
like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.” Bob
 Bob
Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not Bob
to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to Bob
think about how he was going to look on his first day Bob
at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old Bob
elephant skin, probably. Bob
 Bob
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with Bob
wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new Bob
uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as Bob
usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which Bob
he carried everywhere, on the table. Bob
 Bob
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters Bob
on the doormat. Bob

“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from Bob
behind his paper. Bob
 Bob
“Make Harry get it.” Bob
 Bob
“Get the mail, Harry.” Bob
 Bob
“Make Dudley get it.” Bob
 Bob
“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.” Bob
 Bob
Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the Bob
mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard Bob
from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was Bob
vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope Bob
that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. Bob
 Bob
Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging Bob
like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole Bob
life, had written to him. Who would? He had no Bob
friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the Bob
library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for Bob
books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so Bob
plainly there could be no mistake: Bob
 Bob
Mr. H. Potter Bob
 Bob
The Cupboard under the Stairs Bob
4 Privet Drive Bob
Little Whinging Bob
Surrey Bob
 Bob
The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish Bob
parchment, and the address was written in emerald- Bob
green ink. There was no stamp. Bob
 Bob

Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry Bob
saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, Bob
an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large Bob
letter H. Bob
 Bob
“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the Bob
kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter Bob
bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke. Bob
 Bob
Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his Bob
letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the Bob
postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the Bob
yellow envelope. Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, Bob
and flipped over the postcard. Bob
 Bob
“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny Bob
whelk ...” Bob
 Bob
“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got Bob
something!” Bob
 Bob
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which Bob
was written on the same heavy parchment as the Bob
envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand Bob
by Uncle Vernon. Bob
 Bob
“That’s mine\” said Harry, trying to snatch it back. Bob
 Bob
“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, Bob
shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at Bob
it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of Bob
traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds Bob
it was the grayish white of old porridge. Bob
 Bob
“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Bob
Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia Bob
took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment Bob
it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her Bob
throat and made a choking noise. Bob
 Bob
“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!” Bob
 Bob
They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten Bob
that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley Bob
wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a Bob
sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. Bob
 Bob
“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly. Bob
 Bob
“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.” Bob
 Bob
“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing Bob
the letter back inside its envelope. Bob
 Bob
Harry didn’t move. Bob
 Bob
“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted. Bob
 Bob
“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley. Bob
 Bob
“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry Bob
and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw Bob
them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind Bob
them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but Bob
silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Bob
Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one Bob
ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack Bob
between door and floor. Bob
 Bob
“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering Bob
voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly Bob
know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re Bob
watching the house?” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“Watching — spying — might be following us,” Bob
muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. Bob
 Bob
“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write Bob
back? Tell them we don’t want — ” Bob
 Bob
Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes Bob
pacing up and down the kitchen. Bob
 Bob
“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t Bob
get an answer. ... Yes, that’s best ... we won’t do Bob
anything. ...” Bob
 Bob
“But — ” Bob
 Bob
“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we Bob
swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that Bob
dangerous nonsense?” Bob
 Bob
That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Bob
Vernon did something he’d never done before; he Bob
visited Harry in his cupboard. Bob
 Bob
“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Bob
Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s Bob
writing to me?” Bob
 Bob
“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Bob
Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.” Bob
 Bob
“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my Bob
cupboard on it.” Bob
 Bob
“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of Bob
spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep Bob
breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which Bob
looked quite painful. Bob
 Bob

“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt Bob
and I have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit Bob
big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved Bob
into Dudley’s second bedroom.” Bob
 Bob
“Why?” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this Bob
stuff upstairs, now.” Bob
 Bob
The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Bob
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors Bob
(usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Bob
Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys Bob
and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It Bob
only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything Bob
he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat Bob
down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly Bob
everything in here was broken. The month-old video Bob
camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Bob
Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s Bob
dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television Bob
set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite Bob
program had been canceled; there was a large Bob
birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley Bob
had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was Bob
up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley Bob
had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They Bob
were the only things in the room that looked as Bob
though they’d never been touched. Bob
 Bob
From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling Bob
at his mother, “I don’t want him in there ... I need Bob
that room ... make him get out. ...” Bob
 Bob
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday Bob
he’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d Bob
rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than Bob
up here without it. Bob

 Bob
Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Bob
Dudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his Bob
father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, Bob
kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through Bob
the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room Bob
back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday Bob
and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Bob
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each Bob
other darkly. Bob
 Bob
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to Bob
be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get Bob
it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting Bob
stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, Bob
“There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bob
Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive — ’ ” Bob
 Bob
With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his Bob
seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Bob
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to Bob
get the letter from him, which was made difficult by Bob
the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around Bob
the neck from behind. After a minute of confused Bob
fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Bob
Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, Bob
gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his Bob
hand. Bob
 Bob
“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he Bob
wheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.” Bob
 Bob
Harry walked round and round his new room. Bob
Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and Bob
they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first Bob
letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this Bob
time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan. Bob
 Bob
The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next Bob
morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed Bob
 Bob

 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole Bob
downstairs without turning on any of the lights. Bob
 Bob
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Bob
Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. Bob
His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall Bob
toward the front door — Bob
 Bob
“AAAAARRRGH ! ” Bob
 Bob
Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something Bob
big and squashy on the doormat — something alive\ Bob
 Bob
Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry Bob
realized that the big, squashy something had been his Bob
uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot Bob
of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making Bob
sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been Bob
trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an Bob
hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Bob
Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by Bob
the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Bob
Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters Bob
addressed in green ink. Bob
 Bob
“I want — ” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing Bob
the letters into pieces before his eyes. Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at Bob
home and nailed up the mail slot. Bob
 Bob
“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a Bob
mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll Bob
just give up.” Bob
 Bob
“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Bob
Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Bob

Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of Bob
fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. Bob
 Bob
On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Bob
Harry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they Bob
had been pushed under the door, slotted through the Bob
sides, and a few even forced through the small Bob
window in the downstairs bathroom. Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all Bob
the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and Bob
boarded up the cracks around the front and back Bob
doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Bob
Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at Bob
small noises. Bob
 Bob
On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Bob
Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the Bob
house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two Bob
dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had Bob
handed Aunt Petunia through the living room Bob
window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone Bob
calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find Bob
someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the Bob
letters in her food processor. Bob
 Bob
“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Bob
Dudley asked Harry in amazement. Bob

On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the Bob
breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. Bob
 Bob
“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully Bob
as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no Bob
damn letters today — ” Bob
 Bob

Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney Bob
as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of Bob
the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came Bob
pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys Bob
ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch Bob
one — Bob
 Bob
“Out! OUT!” Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and Bob
threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Bob
Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Bob
Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could Bob
hear the letters still streaming into the room, Bob
bouncing off the walls and floor. Bob
 Bob
“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak Bob
calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at Bob
the same time. “I want you all back here in five Bob
minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack Bob
some clothes. No arguments!” Bob
 Bob
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache Bob
missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later Bob
they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up Bob
doors and were in the car, speeding toward the Bob
highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his Bob
father had hit him round the head for holding them Bob
up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and Bob
computer in his sports bag. Bob
 Bob
They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t Bob
dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Bob
Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in Bob
the opposite direction for a while. Bob
 Bob
“Shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,” he would mutter Bob
whenever he did this. Bob

They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Bob
Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day Bob
in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television Bob
programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so Bob
long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- Bob
looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley Bob
and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, Bob
musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, Bob
sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of Bob
passing cars and wondering... Bob
 Bob
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on Bob
toast for breakfast the next day. They had just Bob
finished when the owner of the hotel came over to Bob
their table. Bob
 Bob
“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I Bob
got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” Bob

She held up a letter so they could read the green ink Bob
address: Bob

Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon Bob
knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. Bob
 Bob
“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up Bob
quickly and following her from the dining room. Bob

“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Bob
Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Bob
Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was Bob
looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into Bob
the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook Bob
his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. Bob
The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed Bob
field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the Bob
top of a multilevel parking garage. Bob
 Bob
“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Bob
Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had Bob
parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, Bob
and disappeared. Bob
 Bob
It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the Bob
car. Dudley sniveled. Bob
 Bob
“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Bob
Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with Bob
a television.” Bob
 Bob
Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Bob
Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to Bob
know the days of the week, because of television — Bob
then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh Bob
birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly Bob
fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat Bob
hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, Bob
you weren’t eleven every day. Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was Bob
also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Bob
Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought. Bob
 Bob
“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Bob
 Bob
Everyone out!” Bob
 Bob

It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was Bob
pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at Bob
sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most Bob
miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing Bob
was certain, there was no television in there. Bob
 Bob
“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon Bob
gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this Bob
gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!” Bob
 Bob
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, Bob
pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat Bob
bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. Bob
 Bob
“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, Bob
“so all aboard!” Bob
 Bob
It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain Bob
crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped Bob
their faces. After what seemed like hours they Bob
reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and Bob
sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. Bob
 Bob
The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of Bob
seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the Bob
wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. Bob
There were only two rooms. Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips Bob
each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the Bob
empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. Bob
 Bob
“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said Bob
cheerfully. Bob
 Bob
He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought Bob
nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a Bob
storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though Bob
the thought didn’t cheer him up at all. Bob

 Bob
As night fell, the promised storm blew up around Bob
them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls Bob
of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy Bob
windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in Bob
the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on Bob
the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off Bob
to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find Bob
the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under Bob
the thinnest, most ragged blanket. Bob
 Bob
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the Bob
night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and Bob
turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach Bob
rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned Bob
by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. Bob
The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was Bob
dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Bob
Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and Bob
watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Bob
Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the Bob
letter writer was now. Bob
 Bob
Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak Bob
outside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, Bob
although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes Bob
to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so Bob
full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to Bob
steal one somehow. Bob
 Bob
Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard Bob
on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what Bob
was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock Bob
crumbling into the sea? Bob
 Bob
One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds Bob
... twenty ... ten ... nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley Bob
up, just to annoy him — three ... two ... one ... Bob
 Bob
BOOM. Bob

 Bob
“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly. Bob
 Bob
There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon Bob
came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in Bob
his hands — now they knew what had been in the Bob
long, thin package he had brought with them. Bob
 Bob
“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!” Bob
 Bob
There was a pause. Then — Bob
 Bob
SMASH! Bob
 Bob
The door was hit with such force that it swung clean Bob
off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat Bob
on the floor. Bob
 Bob
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His Bob
face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy Bob
mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under Bob
all the hair. Bob
 Bob
The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so Bob
that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, Bob
picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its Bob
frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. Bob
He turned to look at them all. Bob
 Bob
“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not Bob
been an easy journey. ...” Bob
 Bob
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen Bob
with fear. Bob
 Bob
“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger. Bob
 Bob
Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, Bob
who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. Bob
 Bob
“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant. Bob
 Bob
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face Bob
and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. Bob
 Bob
“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the Bob
giant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer Bob
mom’s eyes.” Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. Bob
 Bob
“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You Bob
are breaking and entering!” Bob
 Bob
“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the Bob
giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the Bob
gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot Bob
as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw Bob
it into a corner of the room. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a Bob
mouse being trodden on. Bob
 Bob
“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back Bob
on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got Bob
summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some Bob
point, but it’ll taste all right.” Bob
 Bob
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled Bob
a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with Bob
trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate Bob
cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green Bob
icing. Bob
 Bob
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank Bob
you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, Bob
and what he said instead was, “Who are you?” Bob
 Bob
The giant chuckled. Bob
 Bob
“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Bob
Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” Bob
 Bob
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s Bob
whole arm. Bob
 Bob
“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his Bob
hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if Bob
yeh’ve got it, mind.” Bob
 Bob
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled Bob
chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the Bob
fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but Bob
when he drew back a second later, there was a Bob
roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with Bob
flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over Bob
him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath. Bob
 Bob

The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged Bob
under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things Bob
out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a Bob
squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, Bob
several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber Bob
liquid that he took a swig from before starting to Bob
make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and Bob
smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while Bob
the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, Bob
juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley Bob
fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t Bob
touch anything he gives you, Dudley.” Bob
 Bob
The giant chuckled darkly. Bob
 Bob
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ Bob
anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” Bob
 Bob
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry Bob
he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he Bob
still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as Bob
nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, Bob
“I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” Bob
 Bob
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with Bob
the back of his hand. Bob
 Bob
“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I Bob
told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll Bob
know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” Bob
 Bob
“Er — no,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid looked shocked. Bob
 Bob
“Sorry,” Harry said quickly. Bob
 Bob
“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Bob
Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s Bob

them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ Bob
yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even Bob
know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh Bob
never wonder where yer parents learned it all?” Bob
 Bob
“All what?” asked Harry. Bob
 Bob
“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one Bob
second!” Bob
 Bob
He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill Bob
the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against Bob
the wall. Bob
 Bob
“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, Bob
“that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — Bob
about ANYTHING?” Bob
 Bob
Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to Bob
school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad. Bob
 Bob
“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do Bob
math and stuff.” Bob
 Bob
But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About Bob
our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ Bob
world.” Bob
 Bob
“What world?” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. Bob
“DURSLEY!” he boomed. Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered Bob
something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid Bob
stared wildly at Harry. Bob

“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he Bob
said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.” Bob
 Bob
“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were Bob
they?” Bob
 Bob
“Yeh don’ know ... yeh don’ know ...” Hagrid ran his Bob
fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a Bob
bewildered stare. Bob
 Bob
“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally. Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. Bob
 Bob
“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid Bob
you to tell the boy anything!” Bob
 Bob
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have Bob
quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; Bob
when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with Bob
rage. Bob
 Bob
“You never told him? Never told him what was in the Bob
letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Bob
Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from Bob
him all these years?” Bob
 Bob
“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly. Bob
 Bob
“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. Bob
 Bob
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. Bob
 Bob
“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. Bob
“Harry — yer a wizard.” Bob
 Bob
There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and Bob
the whistling wind could be heard. Bob

“I’m a what?” gasped Harry. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down Bob
on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ Bob
a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained Bob
up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else Bob
would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read Bob
yer letter.” Bob
 Bob
Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the Bob
yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. Bob
H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He Bob
pulled out the letter and read: Bob
 Bob

Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks Bob
and he couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few Bob
minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they Bob
await my owl?” Bob
 Bob
“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, Bob
clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to Bob
knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket Bob
inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, Bob
rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of Bob
parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he Bob
scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Bob
 Bob
Dear Professor Dumbledore, Bob
 Bob
Given Harry his letter. Bob
 Bob
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Bob
 Bob
Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid Bob
 Bob
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which Bob
clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw Bob
the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and Bob
sat down as though this was as normal as talking on Bob
the telephone. Bob
 Bob
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it Bob
quickly. Bob
 Bob
“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very Bob
angry, moved into the firelight. Bob
 Bob
“He’s not going,” he said. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid grunted. Bob

 Bob
 Bob
“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he Bob
said. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“A what?” said Harry, interested. Bob
 Bob
“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic Bob
folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a Bob
family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” Bob
 Bob
“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to Bob
that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp Bob
it out of him! Wizard indeed!” Bob
 Bob
“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a Bob
wizard?” Bob
 Bob
“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew\ Of Bob
course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted Bob
sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just Bob
like that and disappeared off to that — that school — Bob
and came home every vacation with her pockets full Bob
of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the Bob
only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! Bob
 Bob
But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this Bob
and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in Bob
the family!” Bob
 Bob
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went Bob
ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all Bob
this for years. Bob
 Bob
“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and Bob
got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d Bob
be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — Bob
abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got Bob
herself blown up and we got landed with you!” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his Bob
voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a Bob
car crash!” Bob
 Bob
“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily Bob
that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How Bob
could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an Bob
outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own Bob
story when every kid in our world knows his name!” Bob
 Bob
“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently. Bob
 Bob
The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked Bob
suddenly anxious. Bob
 Bob
“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried Bob
voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there Bob
might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh Bob
didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right Bob
person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t Bob
go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” Bob
 Bob
He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. Bob
 Bob
“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — Bob
mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, Bob
parts of it. ...” Bob
 Bob
He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, Bob
and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a Bob
person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his Bob
name, everyone in our world knows — ” Bob
 Bob
“Who?” Bob
 Bob
“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No Bob
one does.” Bob
 Bob
“Why not?” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Bob
Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard Bob
who went ... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Bob
Worse than worse. His name was ...” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. Bob
 Bob
“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. Bob
 Bob
“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid Bob
shuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this Bob
— this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started Bob
lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid, Bob
some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was Bob
gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Bob
Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly Bob
with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things Bob
happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up Bob
to him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only Bob
safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s Bob
the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare Bob
try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway. Bob
 Bob
“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ Bob
wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts Bob
in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know- Bob
Who never tried to get ’em on his side before . . . Bob
probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter Bob
want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side. Bob
 Bob
“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em ... maybe Bob
he just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows Bob
is, he turned up in the village where you was all Bob
living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a Bob
year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted Bob
handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a Bob
foghorn. Bob
 Bob
Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum Bob
an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the Bob
real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Bob
Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or Bob
maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do Bob
it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer Bob
forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh Bob
get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took Bob
care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it Bob
didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. Bob
No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one Bob
except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches Bob
an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, Bob
the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you Bob
lived.” Bob
 Bob
Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. Bob
As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the Bob
blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had Bob
ever remembered it before — and he remembered Bob
something else, for the first time in his life: a high, Bob
cold, cruel laugh. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid was watching him sadly. Bob
 Bob
“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Bob
Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...” Bob
 Bob
“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; Bob
he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Bob
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his Bob
courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were Bob
clenched. Bob
 Bob
“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept Bob
there’s something strange about you, probably Bob
 Bob

nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as Bob
for all this about your parents, well, they were Bob
weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off Bob
without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, Bob
getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just Bob
what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky Bob
end — ” Bob
 Bob
But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and Bob
drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Bob
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, Bob
“I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one Bob
more word ...” Bob
 Bob
In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella Bob
by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed Bob
again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell Bob
silent. Bob
 Bob
“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and Bob
sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged Bob
right down to the floor. Bob
 Bob
Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, Bob
hundreds of them. Bob
 Bob
“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You- Bob
Know-Who?” Bob
 Bob
“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same Bob
night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more Bob
famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see ... he was Bob
gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go? Bob
 Bob
“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno Bob
if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say Bob
he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ Bob
believe it. People who was on his side came back ter Bob

 Bob

ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ Bob
reckon they could’ve done if he was cornin’ back. Bob
 Bob
“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but Bob
lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause Bob
somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was Bob
somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — Bob
/ dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ Bob
about you stumped him, all right.” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect Bob
blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling Bob
pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a Bob
horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he Bob
possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by Bob
Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Bob
Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they Bob
been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried Bob
to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the Bob
greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had Bob
always been able to kick him around like a football? Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have Bob
made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.” Bob
 Bob
To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. Bob
 Bob
“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when Bob
you was scared or angry?” Bob
 Bob
Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think Bob
about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his Bob
aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when Bob
he, Harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by Bob
Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of Bob
their reach . . . dreading going to school with that Bob
ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow Bob
back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he Bob
was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him? Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Bob
Hagrid was positively beaming at him. Bob
 Bob
“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you Bob
wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” Bob
 Bob
But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a Bob
fight. Bob
 Bob
“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s Bob
going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve Bob
read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — Bob
spell books and wands and — ” Bob
 Bob
“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop Bob
him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s Bob
son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been Bob
down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest Bob
school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven Bob
years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with Bob
youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be Bob
under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Bob
Albus Dumbled — ” Bob
 Bob
“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD Bob
FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Bob
Vernon. Bob
 Bob
But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his Bob
umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER — ” he Bob
thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE Bob
— IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” Bob
 Bob
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the Bob
air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet Bob
light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and Bob

 Bob
the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with Bob
his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in Bob
pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a Bob
curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Bob
Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified Bob
look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his Bob
beard. Bob
 Bob
“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it Bob
didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, Bob
but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there Bob
wasn’t much left ter do.” Bob
 Bob
He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy Bob
eyebrows. Bob
 Bob
“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Bob
Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do Bob
magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter Bob
follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ Bob
the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — ” Bob
 Bob
“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — Bob
got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. Bob
They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But Bob
Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great Bob
man, Dumbledore.” Bob
 Bob
“Why were you expelled?” Bob
 Bob
“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” Bob
said Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer Bob
books an’ that.” Bob
 Bob

Harry woke early the next morning. Although he Bob
could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. Bob
 Bob
“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a Bob
giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a Bob
school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at Bob
home in my cupboard.” Bob
 Bob
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. Bob
 Bob
And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry Bob
thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his Bob
eyes. It had been such a good dream. Bob
 Bob
Tap. Tap. Tap. Bob
 Bob
“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” Bob
 Bob
He sat up and Hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off him. The Bob
hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid Bob
himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a Bob
newspaper held in its beak. Bob
 Bob
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as Bob
though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He Bob
went straight to the window and jerked it open. The Bob
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Bob
Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered Bob
onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid ’s coat. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t do that.” Bob
 Bob
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it Bob
snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on Bob
savaging the coat. Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl — ” Bob
 Bob
“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa. Bob
 Bob
“What?” Bob
 Bob
“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the Bob
pockets.” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid ’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but Bob
pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of Bob
string, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, Harry Bob
pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. Bob
 Bob
“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily. Bob
 Bob
“Knuts?” Bob
 Bob
“The little bronze ones.” Bob
 Bob
Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl Bob
held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a Bob
 Bob
 Bob

small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off Bob
through the open window. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. Bob
 Bob
“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter Bob
London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” Bob
 Bob
Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking Bob
at them. He had just thought of something that made Bob
him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had Bob
got a puncture. Bob
 Bob
“Urn — Hagrid?” Bob
 Bob
“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge Bob
boots. Bob
 Bob
“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Bob
Vernon last night ... he won’t pay for me to go and Bob
learn magic.” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up Bob
and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents Bob
didn’t leave yeh anything?” Bob
 Bob
“But if their house was destroyed — ” Bob
 Bob
“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, Bob
first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a Bob
sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no Bob
teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” Bob
 Bob
“Wizards have banks?” Bob
 Bob
“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.” Bob
 Bob
Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Goblins?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh Bob
that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the Bob
safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter Bob
keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ Bob
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. Bob
Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. Bob
“He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Bob
Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows Bob
he can trust me, see. Bob
 Bob
“Got everythin’? Come on, then.” Bob
 Bob
Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was Bob
quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. Bob
The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with Bob
a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. Bob
 Bob
“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around Bob
for another boat. Bob
 Bob
“Flew,” said Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
“Flew?” Bob
 Bob
“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter Bob
use magic now I’ve got yeh.” Bob
 Bob
They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Bob
Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. Bob
 Bob
“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Bob
Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er Bob
— speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not Bob
mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” Bob
 Bob
“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Bob
Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it Bob
 Bob

 Bob
twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward Bob
land. Bob
 Bob
“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Bob
Harry asked. Bob
 Bob
“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his Bob
newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons Bob
guardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta Bob
find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under Bob
London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die Bob
of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter Bob
get yer hands on summat.” Bob
 Bob
Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read Bob
his newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned Bob
from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone Bob
while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d Bob
never had so many questions in his life. Bob
 Bob
“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid Bob
muttered, turning the page. Bob
 Bob
“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he Bob
could stop himself. Bob
 Bob
“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Bob
Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so Bob
old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there Bob
was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every Bob
morning, askin’ fer advice.” Bob
 Bob
“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?” Bob
 Bob
“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles Bob
that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the Bob
country.” Bob
 Bob
“Why?” Bob
 Bob
Page | 72 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic Bob
solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left Bob
alone.” Bob
 Bob
At this moment the boat bumped gently into the Bob
harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and Bob
they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. Bob
 Bob
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked Bob
through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t Bob
blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as Bob
anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary Bob
things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See Bob
that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep Bob
up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?” Bob
 Bob
“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a Bob
dragon.” Bob
 Bob
“You’d like one?” Bob
 Bob
“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.” Bob
 Bob
They had reached the station. There was a train to Bob
London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t Bob
understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the Bob
bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. Bob
 Bob
People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid Bob
took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a Bob
canary-yellow circus tent. Bob
 Bob
“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted Bob
stitches. Bob
 Bob
Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. Bob

“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered Bob
aloud. Bob
 Bob
“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
Harry had never been to London before. Although Bob
Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was Bob
obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary Bob
way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Bob
Underground, and complained loudly that the seats Bob
were too small and the trains too slow. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without Bob
magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down Bob
escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with Bob
shops. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; Bob
all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They Bob
passed book shops and music stores, hamburger Bob
restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as Bob
if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an Bob
ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there Bob
really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath Bob
them? Were there really shops that sold spell books Bob
and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge Bob
joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t Bob
known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he Bob
might have thought so; yet somehow, even though Bob
everything Hagrid had told him so far was Bob
unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him. Bob
 Bob
“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Bob
Cauldron. It’s a famous place.” Bob
 Bob
It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t Bob
pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was Bob
there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their Bob
eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the Bob
record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Bob
Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most Bob
peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Bob
Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him Bob
inside. Bob
 Bob
For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A Bob
few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny Bob
glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long Bob
pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old Bob
bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a Bob
toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped Bob
Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Bob
Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the Bob
bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Bob
Hagrid?” Bob
 Bob
“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, Bob
clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and Bob
making Harry’s knees buckle. Bob
 Bob
“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is Bob
this — can this be — ?” Bob
 Bob
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely Bob
still and silent. Bob
 Bob
“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Bob
Potter ... what an honor.” Bob
 Bob
He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Bob
Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. Bob
 Bob
“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.” Bob
 Bob
Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking Bob
at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it Bob
without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was Bob
beaming. Bob
 Bob
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the Bob
next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands Bob
with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. Bob
 Bob
“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting Bob
you at last.” Bob
 Bob
“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.” Bob
 Bob
“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a Bob
flutter.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the Bob
name, Dedalus Diggle.” Bob
 Bob
“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s Bob
top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me Bob
once in a shop.” Bob
 Bob
“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking Bob
around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He Bob
remembers me!” Bob
 Bob
Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Bob
Crockford kept coming back for more. Bob
 Bob
A pale young man made his way forward, very Bob
nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. Bob
 Bob
“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Bob
Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” Bob
 Bob
“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Bob
Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to Bob
meet you.” Bob
 Bob
“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?” Bob
 Bob
“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Bob
Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think Bob
about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” Bob
 Bob
He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your Bob
equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- Bob
book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at Bob
the very thought. Bob
 Bob
But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Bob
Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get Bob
away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make Bob
himself heard over the babble. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.” Bob
 Bob
Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, Bob
and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a Bob
small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but Bob
a trash can and a few weeds. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid grinned at Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Bob
Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind Bob
you, he’s usually tremblin’.” Bob
 Bob
“Is he always that nervous?” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine Bob
while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a Bob
year off ter get some firsthand experience. ... They say Bob
he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a Bob
nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same Bob
since. Scared of the students, scared of his own Bob
subject — now, where’s me umbrella?” Bob
 Bob
Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall Bob
above the trash can. Bob
 Bob
“Three up ... two across ...” he muttered. “Right, Bob
stand back, Harry.” Bob
 Bob
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his Bob
umbrella. Bob
 Bob
The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in Bob
the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider Bob
and wider — a second later they were facing an Bob
archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway Bob
onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of Bob
sight. Bob
 Bob
Page | 79 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” Bob
 Bob
He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped Bob
through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his Bob
shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back Bob
into solid wall. Bob
 Bob
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons Bob
outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Bob
Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Bob
Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. Bob
 Bob
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we Bob
gotta get yer money first.” Bob
 Bob
Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He Bob
turned his head in every direction as they walked up Bob
the street, trying to look at everything at once: the Bob
shops, the things outside them, the people doing their Bob
shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary Bob
was shaking her head as they passed, saying, Bob
 Bob
“Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.” Bob
 Bob
A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign Bob
saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Bob
Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Bob
Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window Bob
with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of Bob
them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest Bob
ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling Bob
telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had Bob
never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of Bob
bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell Bob
books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, Bob
globes of the moon. ... Bob
 Bob
“Gringotts,” said Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
They had reached a snowy white building that Bob
towered over the other little shops. Standing beside Bob
its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of Bob
scarlet and gold, was — Bob
 Bob
“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they Bob
walked up the white stone steps toward him. The Bob
goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a Bob
swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry Bob
noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they Bob
walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of Bob
doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon Bob
them: Bob
 Bob
Enter, stranger, but take heed Bob
 Bob
Of what awaits the sin of greed, Bob
 Bob
For those who take, but do not earn, Bob
 Bob
Must pay most dearly in their turn. Bob
 Bob
So if you seek beneath our floors Bob
 Bob
A treasure that was never yours, Bob
 Bob
Thief, you have been warned, beware Bob
 Bob
Of finding more than treasure there. Bob
 Bob
“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Bob
Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors Bob
and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred Bob
more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long Bob
counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in Bob
brass scales, examining precious stones through Bob
eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were Bob
showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry Bob
made for the counter. Bob
 Bob
“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come Bob
ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” Bob
 Bob
“You have his key, sir?” Bob
 Bob
“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started Bob
emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a Bob
handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of Bob
numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry Bob
watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of Bob
rubies as big as glowing coals. Bob
 Bob
“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden Bob
key. Bob
 Bob
The goblin looked at it closely. Bob
 Bob
“That seems to be in order.” Bob
 Bob
“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Bob
Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out Bob
his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault Bob
seven hundred and thirteen.” Bob
 Bob
The goblin read the letter carefully. Bob
 Bob
“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will Bob
have someone take you down to both vaults. Bob
Griphook!” Bob
 Bob
Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had Bob
crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, Bob
he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the Bob
doors leading off the hall. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred Bob
and thirteen?” Harry asked. Bob
 Bob
“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very Bob
secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. Bob
More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” Bob
 Bob
Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who Bob
had expected more marble, was surprised. They were Bob
in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming Bob
torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were Bob
little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled Bob
and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward Bob
them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty Bob
— and were off. Bob
 Bob
At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting Bob
passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, Bob
left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The Bob
rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Bob
Griphook wasn’t steering. Bob
 Bob
Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, Bob
but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw Bob
a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted Bob
around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they Bob
plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake Bob
where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the Bob
ceiling and floor. Bob
 Bob
“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise Bob
of the cart, “what’s the difference between a Bob
stalagmite and a stalactite?” Bob
 Bob
“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ Bob
ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be Bob
sick.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at Bob
last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid Bob
got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his Bob
knees from trembling. Bob
 Bob
Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke Bob
came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Bob
Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Bob
Heaps of little bronze Knuts. Bob
 Bob
“All yours,” smiled Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t Bob
have known about this or they’d have had it from him Bob
faster than blinking. How often had they complained Bob
how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time Bob
there had been a small fortune belonging to him, Bob
buried deep under London. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. Bob
 Bob
“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. Bob
 Bob
“Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Bob
Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should Bob
be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest Bob
safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven Bob
hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go Bob
more slowly?” Bob
 Bob
“One speed only,” said Griphook. Bob
 Bob
They were going even deeper now and gathering Bob
speed. The air became colder and colder as they Bob
hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over Bob
an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the Bob
side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, Bob
but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff Bob
of his neck. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. Bob
 Bob
“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked Bob
the door gently with one of his long fingers and it Bob
simply melted away. Bob
 Bob
“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be Bob
sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Bob
Griphook. Bob
 Bob
“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Bob
Harry asked. Bob
 Bob
“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a Bob
rather nasty grin. Bob
 Bob
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this Bob
top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned Bob
forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at Bob
the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Bob
Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up Bob
in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up Bob
and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to Bob
know what it was, but knew better than to ask. Bob
 Bob
“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to Bob
me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth Bob
shut,” said Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the Bob
sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where Bob
to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He Bob
didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to Bob
a pound to know that he was holding more money Bob
than he’d had in his whole life — more money than Bob
even Dudley had ever had. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding Bob
toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. Bob
“Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a Bob
pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Bob
Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry Bob
entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous. Bob
 Bob
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all Bob
in mauve. Bob
 Bob
“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to Bob
speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being Bob
fitted up just now, in fact.” Bob
 Bob
In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed Bob
face was standing on a footstool while a second witch Bob
pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Bob
Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over Bob
his head, and began to pin it to the right length. Bob
 Bob
“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” Bob
 Bob
“Yes,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s Bob
up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had Bob
a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them Bob
off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years Bob
can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into Bob
getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.” Bob
 Bob
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. Bob
 Bob
“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on. Bob
 Bob
“No,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Play Quidditch at all?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Bob
Quidditch could be. Bob
 Bob
“ I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to Bob
play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know Bob
what House you 11 be in yet?” Bob
 Bob
“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. Bob
 Bob
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do Bob
they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family Bob
have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d Bob
leave, wouldn’t you?” Bob
 Bob
“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a Bob
bit more interesting. Bob
 Bob
“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, Bob
nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was Bob
standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two Bob
large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in. Bob
 Bob
“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know Bob
something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.” Bob
 Bob
“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of Bob
servant, isn’t he?” Bob
 Bob
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the Bob
boy less and less every second. Bob
 Bob
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a Bob
hut on the school grounds and every now and then he Bob
gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire Bob
to his bed.” Bob
 Bob
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he Bob
with you? Where are your parents?” Bob
 Bob
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel Bob
much like going into the matter with this boy. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. Bob
“But they were our kind, weren’t they?” Bob
 Bob
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you Bob
mean.” Bob
 Bob
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, Bob
do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been Bob
brought up to know our ways. Some of them have Bob
never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, Bob
imagine. I think they should keep it in the old Bob
wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?” Bob
 Bob
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, Bob
“That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for Bob
an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down Bob
from the footstool. Bob
 Bob
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the Bob
drawling boy. Bob
 Bob
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid Bob
had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with Bob
chopped nuts). Bob
 Bob
“What’s up?” said Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment Bob
and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a Bob
bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When Bob
they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Bob
Quidditch?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — Bob
not knowin’ about Quidditch!” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Bob
Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s. Bob
 Bob
“ — and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t Bob
even be allowed in — ” Bob
 Bob
“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh Bob
were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his Bob
parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in Bob
the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Bob
Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best Bob
I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a Bob
long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what Bob
she had fer a sister!” Bob
 Bob
“So what is Quidditch?” Bob
 Bob
“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in Bob
the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — Bob
played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four Bob
balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” Bob
 Bob
“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” Bob
 Bob
“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Bob
Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ” Bob
 Bob
“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily. Bob
 Bob
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. Bob
“There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad Bob
who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.” Bob
 Bob
“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” Bob
 Bob
“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Bob
Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to Bob
the ceiling with books as large as paving stones Bob
bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in Bob
covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a Bob
few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, Bob
who never read anything, would have been wild to get Bob
his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to Bob
drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses Bob
(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies Bob
with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Bob
Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Bob
Vindictus Viridian. Bob
 Bob
“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.” Bob
 Bob
“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter Bob
use magic in the Muggle world except in very special Bob
circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh Bob
couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot Bob
more study before yeh get ter that level.” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, Bob
either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice Bob
set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a Bob
collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Bob
Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make Bob
up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and Bob
rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the Bob
floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders Bob
lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, Bob
and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Bob
Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a Bob

Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at Bob
twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- Bob
black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). Bob

Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list Bob
again. Bob
 Bob
“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got Bob
yeh a birthday present.” Bob
 Bob
Harry felt himself go red. Bob
 Bob
“You don’t have to — ” Bob
 Bob
“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer Bob
animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years Bob
ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they Bob
make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want Bob
owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ Bob
everythin’.” Bob
 Bob
Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Bob
Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling Bob
and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a Bob
large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep Bob
with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop Bob
stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Bob
Quirrell. Bob
 Bob
“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect Bob
you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Bob
Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Bob
Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.” Bob
 Bob
A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really Bob
looking forward to. Bob
 Bob
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold Bob
letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Bob
Wands since 382b. c. A single wand lay on a faded Bob
purple cushion in the dusty window. Bob

 Bob
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the Bob
shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, Bob
empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid Bob
sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had Bob
entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new Bob
questions that had just occurred to him and looked Bob
instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly Bob
right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of Bob
his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here Bob
seemed to tingle with some secret magic. Bob
 Bob
“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Bob
Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a Bob
loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the Bob
spindly chair. Bob
 Bob
An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale Bob
eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the Bob
shop. Bob
 Bob
“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly. Bob
 Bob
“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be Bob
seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. Bob
“You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday Bob
she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten Bob
and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Bob
Nice wand for charm work.” Bob
 Bob
Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished Bob
he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. Bob
 Bob
“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany Bob
wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and Bob
excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father Bob
favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the Bob
wizard, of course.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry Bob
were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself Bob
reflected in those misty eyes. Bob
 Bob
“And that’s where ...” Bob
 Bob
Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s Bob
forehead with a long, white finger. Bob
 Bob
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said Bob
softly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful Bob
wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well, Bob
if I’d known what that wand was going out into the Bob
world to do. ...” Bob
 Bob
He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Bob
Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. Bob
 Bob
... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” Bob
 Bob
“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it Bob
in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, Bob
suddenly stern. Bob
 Bob
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his Bob
feet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added Bob
brightly. Bob
 Bob
“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander Bob
sharply. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he Bob
gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. Bob
 Bob
“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a Bob
piercing look. “Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings Bob
out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?” Bob
 Bob
“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry Bob
from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder Bob
to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he Bob
measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core Bob
of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use Bob
unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the Bob
heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are Bob
the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or Bob
phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will Bob
never get such good results with another wizard’s Bob
wand.” Bob
 Bob
Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which Bob
was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this Bob
on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the Bob
shelves, taking down boxes. Bob
 Bob
“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure Bob
crumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Bob
Potter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon Bob
heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take Bob
it and give it a wave.” Bob
 Bob
Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it Bob
around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his Bob
hand almost at once. Bob
 Bob
“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite Bob
whippy. Try — ” Bob
 Bob
Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand Bob
when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a Bob
half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.” Bob
 Bob
Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Bob
Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands Bob
was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, Bob
but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the Bob
shelves, the happier he seemed to become. Bob
 Bob
“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the Bob
perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — Bob
yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and Bob
phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” Bob
 Bob
Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his Bob
fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it Bob
swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of Bob
red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, Bob
throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid Bob
whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, Bob
bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... Bob
how curious ... how very curious ...” Bob
 Bob
He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it Bob
in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” Bob
 Bob
Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. Bob
 Bob
“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Bob
Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix Bob
whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another Bob
feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed Bob
that you should be destined for this wand when its Bob
brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry swallowed. Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed Bob
how these things happen. The wand chooses the Bob
wizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great Bob
things from you, Mr. Potter. ... After all, He-Who- Bob
Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, Bob
but great.” Bob
 Bob
Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Bob
 Bob
Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for Bob
his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his Bob
shop. Bob
 Bob
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry Bob
and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, Bob
back through the wall, back through the Leaky Bob
Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as Bob
they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how Bob
much people were gawking at them on the Bob
Underground, laden as they were with all their funny- Bob
shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its Bob
cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into Bob
Paddington station; Harry only realized where they Bob
were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. Bob
 Bob
“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he Bob
said. Bob
 Bob
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on Bob
plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Bob
Everything looked so strange, somehow. Bob
 Bob
“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the Bob
best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his Bob
hamburger, trying to find the words. Bob
 Bob
“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All Bob
those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don’t know anything Bob
about magic at all. How can they expect great things? Bob
I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m Bob
famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, Bob
sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard Bob
and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. Bob
 Bob
“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Bob
Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll Bob
be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve Bob
been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll Bob
have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, Bob
’smatter of fact.” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take Bob
him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an Bob
envelope. Bob
 Bob
“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September Bob
— King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems Bob
with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll Bob
know where to find me. ... See yeh soon, Harry.” Bob
 Bob
The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to Bob
watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his Bob
seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he Bob
blinked and Hagrid had gone. Bob

THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM Bob
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS Bob
 Bob
Harry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. Bob
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t Bob
stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Bob
Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him Bob
to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t Bob
speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they Bob
acted as though any chair with Harry in it were Bob
empty. Although this was an improvement in many Bob
ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Bob
 Bob
Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for Bob
company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name Bob
he had found in A History of Magic. His school books Bob
were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late Bob
into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the Bob
open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Bob
Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Bob
Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night Bob
before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, Bob
counting down to September the first. Bob
 Bob
On the last day of August he thought he’d better Bob
speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Bob
Cross station the next day, so he went down to the Bob
living room where they were watching a quiz show on Bob
television. He cleared his throat to let them know he Bob
was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the Bob
room. Bob
 Bob
“Er — Uncle Vernon?” Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. Bob
 Bob
“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to Bob
go to Hogwarts.” Bob
 Bob
Uncle Vernon grunted again. Bob
 Bob
“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” Bob
 Bob
Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. Bob
 Bob
“Thank you.” Bob
 Bob
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon Bob
actually spoke. Bob
 Bob
“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Bob
Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?” Bob
 Bob
Harry didn’t say anything. Bob
 Bob
“Where is this school, anyway?” Bob
 Bob
“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first Bob
time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of Bob
his pocket. Bob
 Bob
Page | 99 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I just take the train from platform nine and three- Bob
quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read. Bob
 Bob
His aunt and uncle stared. Bob
 Bob
“Platform what?” Bob
 Bob
“Nine and three-quarters.” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no Bob
platform nine and three-quarters.” Bob
 Bob
“It’s on my ticket.” Bob
 Bob
“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of Bob
them. You 11 see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take Bob
you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London Bob
tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” Bob
 Bob
“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying Bob
to keep things friendly. Bob
 Bob
“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Bob
Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before Bob
he goes to Smeltings.” Bob
 Bob
Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was Bob
too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up Bob
and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to Bob
walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d Bob
change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet Bob
again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw Bob
that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then Bob
paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Bob
Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been Bob
loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had Bob
talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had Bob
set off. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Bob
Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and Bob
wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this Bob
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, Bob
facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. Bob
 Bob
“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform Bob
ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the Bob
middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do Bob
they?” Bob
 Bob
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic Bob
number nine over one platform and a big plastic Bob
number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, Bob
nothing at all. Bob
 Bob
“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even Bob
nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry Bob
turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of Bob
them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. Bob
What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to Bob
attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d Bob
have to ask someone. Bob
 Bob
He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention Bob
platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had Bob
never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t Bob
even tell him what part of the country it was in, he Bob
started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being Bob
stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for Bob
the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said Bob
there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, Bob
muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying Bob
hard not to panic. According to the large clock over Bob
the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on Bob
the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; Bob
he was stranded in the middle of a station with a Bob
trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard Bob
money, and a large owl. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you Bob
had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to Bob
get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get Bob
out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s Bob
stand between platforms nine and ten. Bob
 Bob
At that moment a group of people passed just behind Bob
him and he caught a few words of what they were Bob
saying. Bob
 Bob
“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ” Bob
 Bob
Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump Bob
woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming Bob
red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Bob
Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl. Bob
 Bob
Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. Bob
They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear Bob
what they were saying. Bob
 Bob
“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ Bob
mother. Bob
 Bob
“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red- Bob
headed, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Bob
Percy, you go first.” Bob
 Bob
What looked like the oldest boy marched toward Bob
platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to Bob
blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy Bob
reached the dividing barrier between the two Bob
platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in Bob
front of him and by the time the last backpack had Bob
cleared away, the boy had vanished. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, Bob
woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell Bob
I’m George?” Bob
 Bob
“Sorry, George, dear.” Bob
 Bob
“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he Bob
went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he Bob
must have done so, because a second later, he had Bob
gone — but how had he done it? Bob
 Bob
Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the Bob
barrier — he was almost there — and then, quite Bob
suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere. Bob
 Bob
There was nothing else for it. Bob
 Bob
“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman. Bob
 Bob
“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s Bob
new, too.” Bob
 Bob
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He Bob
was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands Bob
and feet, and a long nose. Bob
 Bob
“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t Bob
know how to — ” Bob
 Bob
“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Bob
Harry nodded. Bob
 Bob
“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk Bob
straight at the barrier between platforms nine and Bob
ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into Bob
it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if Bob
you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.” Bob
 Bob
Page | 103 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Er — okay,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
He pushed his trolley around and stared at the Bob
barrier. It looked very solid. Bob
 Bob
He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on Bob
their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked Bob
more quickly. He was going to smash right into that Bob
barrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward Bob
on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier Bob
was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able Bob
to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot Bob
away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — Bob
 Bob
It didn’t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his Bob
eyes. Bob
 Bob
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform Bob
packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Bob
Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and Bob
saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had Bob
been, with the words Platform Nine and Three- Bob
Quarters on it. He had done it. Bob
 Bob
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the Bob
chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound Bob
here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one Bob
another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble Bob
and the scraping of heavy trunks. Bob
 Bob
The first few carriages were already packed with Bob
students, some hanging out of the window to talk to Bob
their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed Bob
his cart off down the platform in search of an empty Bob
seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, Bob
“Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small Bob
crowd. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Give us a look, Lee, go on.” Bob
 Bob
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the Bob
people around him shrieked and yelled as something Bob
inside poked out a long, hairy leg. Bob
 Bob
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found Bob
an empty compartment near the end of the train. He Bob
put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and Bob
heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift Bob
it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and Bob
twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. Bob
 Bob
“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins Bob
he’d followed through the barrier. Bob
 Bob
“Yes, please,” Harry panted. Bob
 Bob
“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!” Bob
 Bob
With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked Bob
away in a corner of the compartment. Bob
 Bob
“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of Bob
his eyes. Bob
 Bob
“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, Bob
pointing at Harry’s lightning scar. Bob
 Bob
“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?” Bob
 Bob
“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Bob
Harry. Bob
 Bob
“What?” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
Page | 105 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“ Harry Potter,” chorused the twins. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.” Bob
 Bob
The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself Bob
turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating Bob
in through the train’s open door. Bob
 Bob
“Fred? George? Are you there?” Bob
 Bob
“Coming, Mom.” Bob
 Bob
With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the Bob
train. Bob
 Bob
Harry sat down next to the window where, half Bob
hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the Bob
platform and hear what they were saying. Their Bob
mother had just taken out her handkerchief. Bob
 Bob
“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” Bob
 Bob
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she Bob
grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. Bob
 Bob
“Mom — geroff.” He wriggled free. Bob
 Bob
“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” Bob
said one of the twins. Bob
 Bob
“Shut up,” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Where’s Percy?” said their mother. Bob
 Bob
“He’s coming now.” Bob
 Bob
The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had Bob
already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts Bob
 Bob
 Bob

robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge Bob
on his chest with the letter P on it. Bob
 Bob
“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the Bob
prefects have got two compartments to themselves — ” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, Bob
with an air of great surprise. “You should have said Bob
something, we had no idea.” Bob
 Bob
“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something Bob
about it,” said the other twin. “Once — ” Bob
 Bob
“Or twice — ” Bob
 Bob
“A minute — ” Bob
 Bob
“All summer — ” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect. Bob
 Bob
“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one Bob
of the twins. Bob
 Bob
“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All Bob
right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl Bob
when you get there.” Bob
 Bob
She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she Bob
turned to the twins. Bob
 Bob
“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I Bob
get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up Bob
a toilet or — ” Bob
 Bob
“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” Bob
“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.” Bob
 Bob
“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as Bob
the twins already and his nose was still pink where Bob
his mother had rubbed it. Bob
 Bob
“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on Bob
the train?” Bob
 Bob
Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him Bob
looking. Bob
 Bob
“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in Bob
the station? Know who he is?” Bob
 Bob
“Who?” Bob
 Bob
“ Harry Potted” Bob
 Bob
Harry heard the little girl’s voice. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, Bob
oh please. ...” Bob
 Bob
“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy Bob
isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Bob
Fred? How do you know?” Bob
 Bob
“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like Bob
lightning.” Bob
 Bob
“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He Bob
was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the Bob
platform.” Bob

Their mother suddenly became very stern. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As Bob
though he needs reminding of that on his first day at Bob
school.” Bob
 Bob
“All right, keep your hair on.” Bob
 Bob
A whistle sounded. Bob
 Bob
“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys Bob
clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the Bob
window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their Bob
younger sister began to cry. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” Bob
 Bob
“Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.” Bob
 Bob
“ Georg e\” Bob
 Bob
“Only joking, Mom.” Bob
 Bob
The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother Bob
waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, Bob
running to keep up with the train until it gathered too Bob
much speed, then she fell back and waved. Bob
 Bob
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as Bob
the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the Bob
window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He Bob
didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be Bob
better than what he was leaving behind. Bob
 Bob
The door of the compartment slid open and the Bob
youngest redheaded boy came in. Bob
 Bob
“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat Bob
opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.” Bob

 Bob
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He Bob
glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the Bob
window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he Bob
still had a black mark on his nose. Bob
 Bob
“Hey, Ron.” Bob
 Bob
The twins were back. Bob
 Bob
“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Bob
 Bob
Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” Bob
 Bob
“Right,” mumbled Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce Bob
ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, Bob
our brother. See you later, then.” Bob
 Bob
“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the Bob
compartment door shut behind them. Bob
 Bob
“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out. Bob
 Bob
Harry nodded. Bob
 Bob
“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and Bob
George’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — Bob
you know ...” Bob
 Bob
He pointed at Harry’s forehead. Bob
 Bob
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning Bob
scar. Ron stared. Bob
 Bob
“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” Bob
 Bob
“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” Bob
 Bob
“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing Bob
else.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few Bob
moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized Bob
what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the Bob
window again. Bob
 Bob
“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Bob
Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. Bob
 Bob
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a Bob
second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk Bob
about him.” Bob
 Bob
“So you must know loads of magic already.” Bob
 Bob
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding Bob
families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked Bob
about. Bob
 Bob
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. Bob
“What are they like?” Bob
 Bob
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle Bob
and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard Bob
brothers.” Bob
 Bob
“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking Bob
gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. Bob
You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Bob
Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Bob
Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a Bob
prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they Bob
still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re Bob
really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the Bob
others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it Bob
first. You never get anything new, either, with five Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, Bob
and Percy’s old rat.” Bob
 Bob
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat Bob
gray rat, which was asleep. Bob
 Bob
“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever Bob
wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being Bob
made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Bob
Scabbers instead.” Bob
 Bob
Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said Bob
too much, because he went back to staring out of the Bob
window. Bob
 Bob
Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not Bob
being able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had Bob
any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Bob
Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes Bob
and never getting proper birthday presents. This Bob
seemed to cheer Ron up. Bob
 Bob
"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything Bob
about being a wizard or about my parents or Bob
Voldemort — ” Bob
 Bob
Ron gasped. Bob
 Bob
“What?” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“ You said You-Know-Who’s name\” said Ron, sounding Bob
both shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, Bob
of all people — ” Bob
 Bob
“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the Bob
name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. Bob
See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn. ... I bet,” he Bob
added, voicing for the first time something that had Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in Bob
the class.” Bob
 Bob
“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Bob
Muggle families and they learn quick enough.” Bob
 Bob
While they had been talking, the train had carried Bob
them out of London. Now they were speeding past Bob
fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a Bob
time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. Bob
 Bob
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering Bob
outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman Bob
slid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart, Bob
dears?” Bob
 Bob
Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, Bob
but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that Bob
he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the Bob
corridor. Bob
 Bob
He had never had any money for candy with the Bob
Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with Bob
gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bob
Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have Bob
Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott’s Bob
Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Bob
Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Bob
Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Bob
Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss Bob
anything, he got some of everything and paid the Bob
woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. Bob
 Bob
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the Bob
compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. Bob
 Bob
“Hungry, are you?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a Bob
pumpkin pasty. Bob
 Bob
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped Bob
it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one Bob
of them apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t Bob
like corned beef.” Bob
 Bob
“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a Bob
pasty. “Go on — ” Bob
 Bob
“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She Bob
hasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, Bob
with five of us.” Bob
 Bob
“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had Bob
anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share Bob
it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, Bob
eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, Bob
and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). Bob
 Bob
“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a Bob
pack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are Bob
they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would Bob
surprise him. Bob
 Bob
“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Bob
Agrippa.” Bob
 Bob
“What?” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs Bob
have cards inside them, you know, to collect — Bob
famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five Bob
hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.” Bob
 Bob
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up Bob
the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon Bob
glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver Bob
 Bob

hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture Bob
was the name Albus Dumbledore. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Bob
Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry turned over his card and read: Bob
 Bob
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE Bob
 Bob
CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Bob
 Bob
Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern Bob
times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his Bob
defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the Bob
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his Bob
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Bob
Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten Bob
pin bowling. Bob
 Bob
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his Bob
astonishment, that Dumbledore ’s face had Bob
disappeared. Bob
 Bob
“He’s gone!” Bob
 Bob
“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” Bob
said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again Bob
and I’ve got about six of her ... do you want it? You Bob
can start collecting.” Bob
 Bob
Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs Bob
waiting to be unwrapped. Bob
 Bob
“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Bob
Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.” Bob
 Bob
Page | 115 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded Bob
amazed. “Weird).” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the Bob
picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron Bob
was more interested in eating the frogs than looking Bob
at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry Bob
couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Bob
Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Bob
Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He Bob
finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, Bob
who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bob
Bott’s Every Flavor Beans. Bob
 Bob
“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Bob
Harry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every Bob
flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like Bob
chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then Bob
you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George Bob
reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” Bob
 Bob
Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, Bob
and bit into a corner. Bob
 Bob
“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.” Bob
 Bob
They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Bob
Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, Bob
curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave Bob
enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron Bob
wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper. Bob
 Bob
The countryside now flying past the window was Bob
becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there Bob
were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. Bob
 Bob
There was a knock on the door of their compartment Bob
and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on Bob
 Bob

 Bob
platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked Bob
tearful. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?” Bob
 Bob
When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost Bob
him! He keeps getting away from me!” Bob
 Bob
“Hell turn up,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him ...” Bob
He left. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d Bob
brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind Bob
you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.” Bob
 Bob
The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap. Bob
 Bob
“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the Bob
difference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him Bob
yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but Bob
the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look ...” Bob
 Bob
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a Bob
very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places Bob
and something white was glinting at the end. Bob
 Bob
“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway — ” Bob
 Bob
He had just raised his wand when the compartment Bob
door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but Bob
this time he had a girl with him. She was already Bob
wearing her new Hogwarts robes. Bob
 Bob
“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. Bob
She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown Bob
hair, and rather large front teeth. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, Bob
but the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the Bob
wand in his hand. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.” Bob
 Bob
She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. Bob
 Bob
“Er — all right.” Bob
 Bob
He cleared his throat. Bob
 Bob
“ Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, Bob
 Bob
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” Bob
 Bob
He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers Bob
stayed gray and fast asleep. Bob
 Bob
“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, Bob
it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells Bob
just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in Bob
my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise Bob
when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of Bob
course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft Bob
there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books Bob
by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Bob
Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” Bob
 Bob
She said all this very fast. Bob
 Bob
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his Bob
stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course Bob
books by heart either. Bob
 Bob
“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered. Bob
 Bob
“Harry Potter,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about Bob
you, of course — I got a few extra books for Bob
background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical Bob
History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Bob
Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” Bob
 Bob
“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed. Bob
 Bob
“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out Bob
everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do Bob
either of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been Bob
asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds Bob
by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, Bob
but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. ... Bob
Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. Bob
 Bob
You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll Bob
be there soon.” Bob
 Bob
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. Bob
 Bob
“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Bob
Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid Bob
spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a Bob
dud.” Bob
 Bob
“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling Bob
on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t Bob
know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Bob
Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put Bob
me in Slytherin.” Bob
 Bob
“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was Bob
in?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, Bob
looking depressed. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are Bob
a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off Bob
Houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that Bob
they’ve left, anyway?” Bob
 Bob
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d Bob
finished school. Bob
 Bob
“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Bob
Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did Bob
you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily Bob
Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Bob
Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security Bob
vault.” Bob
 Bob
Harry stared. Bob
 Bob
“Really? What happened to them?” Bob
 Bob
“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t Bob
been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Bob
Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t Bob
think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, Bob
everyone gets scared when something like this Bob
happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” Bob
 Bob
Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was Bob
starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know- Bob
Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of Bob
entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more Bob
comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying. Bob
 Bob
“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked. Bob
 Bob
“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed. Bob
 Bob
“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s Bob
the best game in the world — ” And he was off, Bob
explaining all about the four balls and the positions of Bob
 Bob

 Bob
the seven players, describing famous games he’d been Bob
to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to Bob
get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry Bob
through the finer points of the game when the Bob
compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Bob
Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this Bob
time. Bob
 Bob
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle Bob
one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s Bob
robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more Bob
interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley. Bob
 Bob
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train Bob
that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is Bob
it?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Bob
Both of them were thickset and looked extremely Bob
mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they Bob
looked like bodyguards. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale Bob
boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. Bob
 Bob
“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” Bob
 Bob
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been Bob
hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. Bob
 Bob
“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who Bob
you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red Bob
hair, freckles, and more children than they can Bob
afford.” Bob
 Bob
He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some Bob
wizarding families are much better than others, Bob
 Bob
Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the Bob
wrong sort. I can help you there.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Page | 121 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry Bob
didn’t take it. Bob
 Bob
“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, Bob
thanks,” he said coolly. Bob
 Bob
Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared Bob
in his pale cheeks. Bob
 Bob
“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. Bob
“Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as Bob
your parents. They didn’t know what was good for Bob
them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Bob
Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” Bob
 Bob
Both Harry and Ron stood up. Bob
 Bob
“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy Bob
sneered. Bob
 Bob
“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely Bob
than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot Bob
bigger than him or Ron. Bob
 Bob
“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve Bob
eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.” Bob
 Bob
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Bob
Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as Bob
touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. Bob
 Bob
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp Bob
little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe Bob
and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers Bob
round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally Bob
flew off and hit the window, all three of them Bob
disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps Bob
they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Bob
Hermione Granger had come in. Bob
 Bob
“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the Bob
sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers Bob
by his tail. Bob
 Bob
“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. Bob
 Bob
He looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it Bob
— he’s gone back to sleep.” Bob
 Bob
And so he had. Bob
 Bob
“You’ve met Malfoy before?” Bob
 Bob
Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. Bob
 Bob
“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were Bob
some of the first to come back to our side after You- Bob
Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. Bob
My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father Bob
didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He Bob
turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with Bob
something?” Bob
 Bob
“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve Bob
just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he Bob
says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, Bob
have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get Bob
there!” Bob
 Bob
“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, Bob
scowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while we Bob
change?” Bob
 Bob
“All right — I only came in here because people Bob
outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and Bob
down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you Bob
know?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the Bob
window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains Bob
and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did Bob
seem to be slowing down. Bob
 Bob
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their Bob
long black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you Bob
could see his sneakers underneath them. Bob
 Bob
A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Bob
Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your Bob
luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school Bob
separately.” Bob
 Bob
Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he Bob
saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed Bob
their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined Bob
the crowd thronging the corridor. Bob
 Bob
The train slowed right down and finally stopped. Bob
People pushed their way toward the door and out on Bob
to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold Bob
night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads Bob
of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: Bob
“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, Bob
Harry?” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. Bob
 Bob
“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer Bob
step, now! Firs’ years follow me!” Bob
 Bob
Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down Bob
what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so Bob
dark on either side of them that Harry thought there Bob
must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once Bob
or twice. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid Bob
called over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” Bob
 Bob
There was a loud “Oooooh!” Bob
 Bob
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge Bob
of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain Bob
on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry Bob
sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. Bob
 Bob
“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to Bob
a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Bob
Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville Bob
and Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to Bob
himself. “Right then — FORWARD!” Bob
 Bob
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, Bob
gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as Bob
glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great Bob
castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed Bob
nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. Bob
 Bob
“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached Bob
the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats Bob
carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide Bob
opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a Bob
dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right Bob
underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of Bob
underground harbor, where they clambered out onto Bob
rocks and pebbles. Bob
 Bob
“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who Bob
was checking the boats as people climbed out of Bob
them. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his Bob
hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the Bob
rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto Bob
smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. Bob
 Bob
They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded Bob
around the huge, oak front door. Bob
 Bob
“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times Bob
on the castle door. Bob

THE SORTING HAT Bob
 Bob
The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired Bob
witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a Bob
very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this Bob
was not someone to cross. Bob
 Bob
“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.” Bob
 Bob
She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so Bob
big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ Bob
house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming Bob
torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too Bob
high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase Bob
facing them led to the upper floors. Bob
 Bob
They followed Professor McGonagall across the Bob
flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of Bob
hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the Bob
rest of the school must already be here — but Bob
Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a Bob
small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, Bob
Page | 127 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
standing rather closer together than they would Bob
usually have done, peering about nervously. Bob
 Bob
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. Bob
“The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but Bob
before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will Bob
be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very Bob
important ceremony because, while you are here, Bob
your House will be something like your family within Bob
Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your Bob
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free Bob
time in your House common room. Bob
 Bob
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Bob
Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own Bob
noble history and each has produced outstanding Bob
witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your Bob
triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- Bob
breaking will lose House points. At the end of the Bob
year, the House with the most points is awarded the Bob
House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a Bob
credit to whichever House becomes yours. Bob
 Bob
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few Bob
minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest Bob
you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can Bob
while you are waiting.” Bob
 Bob
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, Bob
which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s Bob
smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his Bob
hair. Bob
 Bob
“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Bob
Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.” Bob
 Bob
She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Bob
Ron. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but Bob
I think he was joking.” Bob
 Bob
Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of Bob
the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet Bob
— what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t Bob
expected something like this the moment they Bob
arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that Bob
everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking Bob
much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering Bob
very fast about all the spells she’d learned and Bob
wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not Bob
to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, Bob
not even when he’d had to take a school report home Bob
to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his Bob
teachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Bob
Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come Bob
back and lead him to his doom. Bob
 Bob
Then something happened that made him jump about Bob
a foot in the air — several people behind him Bob
screamed. Bob
 Bob
“What the — ?” Bob
 Bob
He gasped. So did the people around him. About Bob
twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back Bob
wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they Bob
glided across the room talking to one another and Bob
hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be Bob
arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was Bob
saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give Bob
him a second chance — ” Bob
 Bob
“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the Bob
chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and Bob
 Bob
Page | 129 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what Bob
are you all doing here?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly Bob
noticed the first years. Bob
 Bob
Nobody answered. Bob
 Bob
“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at Bob
them. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?” Bob
 Bob
A few people nodded mutely. Bob
 Bob
“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old Bob
House, you know.” Bob
 Bob
“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Bob
Ceremony’s about to start.” Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the Bob
ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. Bob
 Bob
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first Bob
years, “and follow me.” Bob
 Bob
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Bob
Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Bob
Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, Bob
back across the hall, and through a pair of double Bob
doors into the Great Hall. Bob
 Bob
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and Bob
splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands Bob
of candles that were floating in midair over four long Bob
tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. Bob
These tables were laid with glittering golden plates Bob
and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long Bob
table where the teachers were sitting. Professor Bob
McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they Bob
Page | 130 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
came to a halt in a line facing the other students, Bob
with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces Bob
staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the Bob
flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among Bob
the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to Bob
avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and Bob
saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Bob
Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky Bob
outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.” Bob
 Bob
It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, Bob
and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the Bob
heavens. Bob
 Bob
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor Bob
McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front Bob
of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed Bob
wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and Bob
extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in Bob
the house. Bob
 Bob
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry Bob
thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — Bob
noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at Bob
the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there Bob
was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip Bob
near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the Bob
hat began to sing: Bob
 Bob
“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, Bob
 Bob
But don’t judge on what you see, Bob
 Bob
I’ll eat myself if you can find Bob
 Bob
A smarter hat than me. Bob
 Bob
You can keep your bowlers black, Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
Your top hats sleek and tall, Bob
 Bob
For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat Bob
And I can cap them all. Bob
 Bob
There’s nothing hidden in your head Bob
The Sorting Hat can’t see, Bob
 Bob
So try me on and I will tell you Bob
Where you ought to be. Bob
 Bob
You might belong in Gryffindor, Bob
 Bob
Where dwell the brave at heart, Bob
 Bob
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Bob
Set Gryffindors apart; Bob
 Bob
You might belong in Hufflepuff, Bob
 Bob
Where they are just and loyal, Bob
 Bob
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true Bob
And unafraid of toil; Bob
 Bob
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, Bob
 Bob
If you’ve a ready mind, Bob
 Bob
Where those of wit and learning, Bob
 Bob
Will always find their kind; Bob
 Bob
Or perhaps in Slytherin Bob

 Bob
So put me on! Don’t be afraid l\ Bob
 Bob
And don’t get in a flap\ Bob
 Bob
You’re in safe hands (though I have none) Bob
 Bob
For I’m a Thinking Cap\” Bob
 Bob
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished Bob
its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then Bob
became quite still again. Bob
 Bob
“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Bob
Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling Bob
a troll.” Bob
 Bob
Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot Bob
better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they Bob
could have tried it on without everyone watching. The Bob
hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel Bob
brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If Bob
only the hat had mentioned a House for people who Bob
felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for Bob
him. Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a Bob
long roll of parchment. Bob
 Bob
“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and Bob
sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Bob
Hannah!” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of Bob
line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her Bob
eyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause — Bob
 Bob
“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat. Bob
 Bob
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Bob
Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Bob
 Bob
Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at Bob
her. Bob
 Bob
“Bones, Susan!” Bob
 Bob
“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan Bob
scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. Bob
 Bob
“Boot, Terry!” Bob
 Bob
“RAVENCLAW!” Bob
 Bob
The table second from the left clapped this time; Bob
several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Bob
Terry as he joined them. Bob
 Bob
“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but Bob
“Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, Bob
and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Bob
Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling. Bob
 Bob
“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Bob
Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d Bob
heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked Bob
like an unpleasant lot. Bob
 Bob
He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He Bob
remembered being picked for teams during gym at his Bob
old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not Bob
because he was no good, but because no one wanted Bob
Dudley to think they liked him. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“HUFFLEPUFF!” Bob
 Bob
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the Bob
House at once, but at others it took a little while to Bob
decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy Bob
next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a Bob
whole minute before the hat declared him a Bob
Gryffindor. Bob
 Bob
“Granger, Hermione!” Bob
 Bob
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat Bob
eagerly on her head. Bob
 Bob
“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned. Bob
 Bob
A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts Bob
always do when you’re very nervous. What if he Bob
wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with Bob
the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor Bob
McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had Bob
obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on Bob
the train? Bob
 Bob
When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his Bob
toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. Bob
The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When Bob
it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still Bob
wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter Bob
to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.” Bob
 Bob
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called Bob
and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched Bob
his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Bob
 Bob
Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, Bob
looking pleased with himself. Bob
 Bob
Page | 135 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
There weren’t many people left now. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Moon” , “Nott” ... , “Parkinson” ... , then a pair of Bob
twin girls, “Path” and “Path” ... , then “Perks, Sally- Bob
Anne” . . . , and then, at last — Bob
 Bob
“Potter, Harry!” Bob
 Bob
As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke Bob
out like little hissing fires all over the hall. Bob
 Bob
“ Potter , did she say?” Bob
 Bob
“ The Harry Potter?” Bob
 Bob
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over Bob
his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a Bob
good look at him. Next second he was looking at the Bob
black inside of the hat. He waited. Bob
 Bob
“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very Bob
difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind Bob
either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a Bob
nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. ... Bob
So where shall I put you?” Bob
 Bob
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Bob
Slytherin, not Slytherin. Bob
 Bob
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you Bob
sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in Bob
your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to Bob
greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re Bob
sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” Bob
 Bob
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole Bob
hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward Bob
the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been Bob
chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed Bob
 Bob
Page | 136 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Bob
Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while Bob
the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Bob
Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff Bob
he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Bob
Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it Bob
into a bucket of ice-cold water. Bob
 Bob
He could see the High Table properly now. At the end Bob
nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave Bob
him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, Bob
in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, Bob
sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once Bob
from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on Bob
the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing Bob
in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Bob
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous Bob
young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking Bob
very peculiar in a large purple turban. Bob
 Bob
And now there were only four people left to be sorted. Bob
“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, Bob
joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” Bob
became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He Bob
was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers Bob
under the table and a second later the hat had Bob
shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Bob
 Bob
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed Bob
into the chair next to him. Bob
 Bob
“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley Bob
pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was Bob
made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her Bob
scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. Bob
 Bob
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had Bob
only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin Bob
pasties seemed ages ago. Bob
 Bob
Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was Bob
beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if Bob
nothing could have pleased him more than to see Bob
them all there. Bob
 Bob
“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Bob
Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like Bob
to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Bob
 Bob
Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Bob
 Bob
“Thank you!” Bob
 Bob
He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Bob
Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. Bob
 Bob
“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly. Bob
 Bob
“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard Bob
in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Bob
Harry?” Bob
 Bob
Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him Bob
were now piled with food. He had never seen so many Bob
things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast Bob
chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, Bob
bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, Bob
fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, Bob
ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint Bob
humbugs. Bob
 Bob
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but Bob
he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Bob
Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really Bob
wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate Bob
with a bit of everything except the peppermints and Bob
began to eat. It was all delicious. Bob
 Bob
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, Bob
watching Harry cut up his steak. Bob
 Bob
Page | 138 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Can’t you — ?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said Bob
the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does Bob
miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir Bob
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Bob
Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” Bob
 Bob
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My Bob
brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Bob
Nick!” Bob
 Bob
“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Bob
— ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Bob
Finnigan interrupted. Bob
 Bob
“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?” Bob
 Bob
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little Bob
chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted. Bob
 Bob
“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and Bob
pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell Bob
onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone Bob
had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it Bob
properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on Bob
their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head Bob
back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Bob
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the Bob
House Championship this year? Gryffindors have Bob
never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have Bob
got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s Bob
becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin Bob
ghost.” Bob
 Bob
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a Bob
horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a Bob
gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He Bob
was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating Bob
arrangements. Bob
 Bob
“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus Bob
with great interest. Bob
 Bob
“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick Bob
delicately. Bob
 Bob
When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the Bob
remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving Bob
them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the Bob
desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor Bob
you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate Bob
eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell- Bob
0, rice pudding ... Bob
 Bob
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk Bob
turned to their families. Bob
 Bob
“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Bob
Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they Bob
were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.” Bob
 Bob
The others laughed. Bob
 Bob
“What about you, Neville?” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” Bob
said Neville, “but the family thought I was all- Muggle Bob
for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me Bob
off my guard and force some magic out of me — he Bob
pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly Bob
drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Bob
Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was Bob
hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles Bob
when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue Bob
and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the Bob
way down the garden and into the road. They were all Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. Bob
And you should have seen their faces when I got in Bob
here — they thought I might not be magic enough to Bob
come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he Bob
bought me my toad.” Bob
 Bob
On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione Bob
were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right Bob
away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly Bob
interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning Bob
something into something else, of course, it’s Bob
supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting Bob
small, just matches into needles and that sort of Bob
thing — ”). Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, Bob
looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was Bob
drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall Bob
was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Bob
Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a Bob
teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and Bob
sallow skin. Bob
 Bob
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher Bob
looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s Bob
eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Bob
Harry’s forehead. Bob
 Bob
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head. Bob
 Bob
“What is it?” asked Percy. Bob
 Bob
“N-nothing.” Bob
 Bob
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder Bob
to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the Bob
teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at Bob
all. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Page | 141 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he Bob
asked Percy. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder Bob
he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He Bob
teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone Bob
knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot Bob
about the Dark Arts, Snape.” Bob
 Bob
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t Bob
look at him again. Bob
 Bob
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Bob
Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. Bob
 Bob
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all Bob
fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to Bob
give you. Bob
 Bob
“First years should note that the forest on the Bob
grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our Bob
older students would do well to remember that as Bob
well.” Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction Bob
of the Weasley twins. Bob
 Bob
“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to Bob
remind you all that no magic should be used between Bob
classes in the corridors. Bob
 Bob
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of Bob
the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House Bob
teams should contact Madam Hooch. Bob
 Bob
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- Bob
floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds Bob
to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful Bob
death.” Bob
 Bob
Page | 142 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy. Bob
 Bob
“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s Bob
odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re Bob
not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of Bob
dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he Bob
might have told us prefects, at least.” Bob
 Bob
“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school Bob
song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other Bob
teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed. Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was Bob
trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden Bob
ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables Bob
and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. Bob
 Bob
“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, Bob
“and off we go!” Bob
 Bob
And the school bellowed: Bob
 Bob
“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Bob
 Bob
Teach us something please, Bob
 Bob
Whether we be old and bald Bob
Or young with scabby knees, Bob
 Bob
Our heads could do with filling Bob
With some interesting stuff, Bob
 Bob
For now they’re bare and full of air, Bob
 Bob
Dead flies and bits of fluff, Bob
 Bob
Page | 143 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
So teach us things worth knowing, Bob
 Bob
Bring back what we’ve forgot, Bob
 Bob
Just do your best, we’ll do the rest, Bob
 Bob
And learn until our brains all rot.” Bob
 Bob
Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, Bob
only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a Bob
very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their Bob
last few lines with his wand and when they had Bob
finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. Bob
 Bob
“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic Bob
beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you Bob
trot!” Bob
 Bob
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the Bob
chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the Bob
marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, Bob
but only because he was so tired and full of food. He Bob
was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in Bob
the portraits along the corridors whispered and Bob
pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them Bob
through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and Bob
hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, Bob
yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just Bob
wondering how much farther they had to go when Bob
they came to a sudden halt. Bob
 Bob
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair Bob
ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them Bob
they started throwing themselves at him. Bob
 Bob
“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A Bob
poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show Bob
yourself.” Bob

A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a Bob
balloon, answered. Bob
 Bob
“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?” Bob
 Bob
There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark Bob
eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- Bob
legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. Bob
 Bob
“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Bob
Firsties! What fun!” Bob
 Bob
He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. Bob
 Bob
“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I Bob
mean it!” barked Percy. Bob
 Bob
Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping Bob
the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him Bob
zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. Bob
 Bob
“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as Bob
they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one Bob
who can control him, he won’t even listen to us Bob
prefects. Here we are.” Bob
 Bob
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a Bob
very fat woman in a pink silk dress. Bob
 Bob
“Password?” she said. Bob
 Bob
“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung Bob
forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all Bob
scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — Bob
and found themselves in the Gryffindor common Bob
room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. Bob
 Bob
Percy directed the girls through one door to their Bob
dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of Bob

a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the Bob
towers — they found their beds at last: five four- Bob
posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their Bob
trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk Bob
much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. Bob
 Bob
“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through Bob
the hangings. “Get off Scabbers! He’s chewing my Bob
sheets.” Bob
 Bob
Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the Bob
treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. Bob
 Bob
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he Bob
had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Bob
Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling Bob
him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it Bob
was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want Bob
to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried Bob
to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there Bob
was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — Bob
then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Bob
Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there Bob
was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating Bob
and shaking. Bob
 Bob
He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he Bob
woke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all. Bob

THE POTIONS MASTER Bob
 Bob
“There, look.” Bob
 Bob
“Where?” Bob
 Bob
“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” Bob
 Bob
“Wearing the glasses?” Bob
 Bob
“Did you see his face?” Bob
 Bob
“Did you see his scar?” Bob
 Bob
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his Bob
dormitory the next day. People lining up outside Bob
classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or Bob
doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, Bob
staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was Bob
trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. Bob
 Bob
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Bob
Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; Bob
some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some Bob
 Bob

 Bob
with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to Bob
remember to jump. Then there were doors that Bob
wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled Bob
them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t Bob
really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It Bob
was also very hard to remember where anything was, Bob
because it all seemed to move around a lot. The Bob
people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, Bob
and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. Bob
 Bob
The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty Bob
shock when one of them glided suddenly through a Bob
door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick Bob
was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the Bob
right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth Bob
two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him Bob
when you were late for class. He would drop Bob
wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from Bob
under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak Bob
up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, Bob
“GOT YOUR CONK!” Bob
 Bob
Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the Bob
caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get Bob
on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Bob
Filch found them trying to force their way through a Bob
door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to Bob
the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He Bob
wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were Bob
trying to break into it on purpose, and was Bob
threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they Bob
were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. Bob
 Bob
Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust- Bob
colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Bob
Filch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule Bob
in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d Bob
whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two Bob
seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of Bob

the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Bob
Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any Bob
of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was Bob
the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a Bob
good kick. Bob
 Bob
And then, once you had managed to find them, there Bob
were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to Bob
magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your Bob
wand and saying a few funny words. Bob
 Bob
They had to study the night skies through their Bob
telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn Bob
the names of different stars and the movements of the Bob
planets. Three times a week they went out to the Bob
greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, Bob
with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, Bob
where they learned how to take care of all the strange Bob
plants and fungi, and found out what they were used Bob
for. Bob
 Bob
Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, Bob
which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Bob
Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen Bob
asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next Bob
morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns Bob
droned on and on while they scribbled down names Bob
and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Bob
Oddball mixed up. Bob
 Bob
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny Bob
little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to Bob
see over his desk. At the start of their first class he Bob
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name Bob
he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had Bob
been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to Bob
 Bob
 Bob

cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking- to Bob
the moment they sat down in her first class. Bob
 Bob
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and Bob
dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she Bob
said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave Bob
and not come back. You have been warned.” Bob
 Bob
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. Bob
They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get Bob
started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be Bob
changing the furniture into animals for a long time. Bob
After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each Bob
given a match and started trying to turn it into a Bob
needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Bob
Granger had made any difference to her match; Bob
Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had Bob
gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare Bob
smile. Bob
 Bob
The class everyone had really been looking forward to Bob
was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s Bob
lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom Bob
smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to Bob
ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was Bob
afraid would be coming back to get him one of these Bob
days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him Bob
by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of Bob
a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they Bob
believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Bob
Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had Bob
fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started Bob
talking about the weather; for another, they had Bob
noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, Bob
and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full Bob
of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected Bob
wherever he went. Bob

Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t Bob
miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come Bob
from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any Bob
idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so Bob
much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have Bob
much of a head start. Bob
 Bob
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They Bob
finally managed to find their way down to the Great Bob
Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. Bob
 Bob
“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he Bob
poured sugar on his porridge. Bob
 Bob
“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. Bob
“Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always Bob
favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” Bob
 Bob
“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor Bob
McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it Bob
hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of Bob
homework the day before. Bob
 Bob
Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to Bob
this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on Bob
the first morning, when about a hundred owls had Bob
suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during Bob
breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their Bob
owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their Bob
laps. Bob
 Bob
Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She Bob
sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of Bob
toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the Bob
other school owls. This morning, however, she Bob
fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar Bob
bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry Bob
tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Dear Harry, Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like Bob
to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? Bob
 Bob
I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an Bob
answer back with Hedwig. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid Bob
 Bob
Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see Bob
you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off Bob
again. Bob
 Bob
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look Bob
forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to Bob
be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. Bob
 Bob
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the Bob
idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of Bob
the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. Bob
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him. Bob
 Bob
Potions lessons took place down in one of the Bob
dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main Bob
castle, and would have been quite creepy enough Bob
without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all Bob
around the walls. Bob
 Bob
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the Bob
roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name. Bob
 Bob
“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — Bob
celebrity.” Bob
 Bob
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle Bob
sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling Bob
the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were Bob
black like Hagrid ’s, but they had none of Hagrid ’s Bob
 Bob

 Bob

 Bob
warmth. They were cold and empty and made you Bob
think of dark tunnels. Bob
 Bob
“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art Bob
of potion-making,” he began. He spoke in barely more Bob
than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Bob
Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a Bob
class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish Bob
wand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe Bob
this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand Bob
the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its Bob
shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that Bob
creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, Bob
ensnaring the senses. ... I can teach you how to bottle Bob
fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t Bob
as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to Bob
teach.” Bob
 Bob
More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Bob
Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Bob
Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked Bob
desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a Bob
dunderhead. Bob
 Bob
“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I Bob
added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of Bob
wormwood?” Bob
 Bob
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry Bob
glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Bob
Hermione ’s hand had shot into the air. Bob
 Bob
“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
Snape ’s lips curled into a sneer. Bob
 Bob
“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” Bob
 Bob
He ignored Hermione ’s hand. Bob
 Bob
Page | 153 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told Bob
you to find me a bezoar?” Bob
 Bob
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it Bob
would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry Bob
didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He Bob
tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who Bob
were shaking with laughter. Bob
 Bob
“I don’t know, sir.” Bob
 Bob
“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, Bob
eh, Potter?” Bob
 Bob
Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into Bob
those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at Bob
the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember Bob
everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Bob
Fungi ? Bob
 Bob
Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand. Bob
 Bob
“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood Bob
and wolfsbane?” Bob
 Bob
At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching Bob
toward the dungeon ceiling. Bob
 Bob
“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione Bob
does, though, why don’t you try her?” Bob
 Bob
A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, Bob
and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not Bob
pleased. Bob
 Bob
“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your Bob
information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a Bob
sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Bob
Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken Bob
 Bob

from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from Bob
most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they Bob
are the same plant, which also goes by the name of Bob
aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?” Bob
 Bob
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and Bob
parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, “And a point Bob
will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Bob
Potter.” Bob
 Bob
Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Bob
Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into Bob
pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to Bob
cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, Bob
watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake Bob
fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, Bob
whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone Bob
to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his Bob
horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a Bob
loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow Bob
managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted Bob
blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone Bob
floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within Bob
seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools Bob
while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion Bob
when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as Bob
angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. Bob
 Bob
“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion Bob
away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you Bob
added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron Bob
off the fire?” Bob
 Bob
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over Bob
his nose. Bob
 Bob
“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Bob
Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who Bob
had been working next to Neville. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add Bob
the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got Bob
it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for Bob
Gryffindor.” Bob
 Bob
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to Bob
argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can Bob
turn very nasty.” Bob
 Bob
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour Bob
later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were Bob
low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very Bob
first week — why did Snape hate him so much? Bob
 Bob
“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points Bob
off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid Bob
with you?” Bob
 Bob
At five to three they left the castle and made their way Bob
across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden Bob
house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow Bob
and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. Bob
 Bob
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling Bob
from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid ’s Bob
voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he Bob
pulled the door open. Bob
 Bob
“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.” Bob
 Bob
He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar Bob
of an enormous black boarhound. Bob
 Bob
There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants Bob
were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a Bob
massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. Bob
 Bob
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Bob
Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started Bob
licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as Bob
fierce as he looked. Bob
 Bob
“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring Bob
boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock Bob
cakes onto a plate. Bob
 Bob
“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s Bob
freckles. “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers Bob
away from the forest.” Bob
 Bob
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins Bob
that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron Bob
pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all Bob
about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Bob
Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes. Bob
 Bob
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Bob
Filch “that old git.” Bob
 Bob
“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce Bob
her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up Bob
ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get Bob
rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.” Bob
 Bob
Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Bob
Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape Bob
liked hardly any of the students. Bob
 Bob
“But he seemed to really hate me.” Bob
 Bob
“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t Bob
quite meet his eyes when he said that. Bob
 Bob
“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I Bob
liked him a lot — great with animals.” Bob
 Bob
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on Bob
purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s Bob
work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper Bob
that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was Bob
a cutting from the Daily Prophet : Bob
 Bob
GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Bob
 Bob
Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts Bob
on 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark Bob
wizards or witches unknown. Bob
 Bob
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had Bob
been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact Bob
been emptied the same day. Bob
 Bob
“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep Bob
your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said Bob
a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. Bob
 Bob
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that Bob
someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t Bob
mentioned the date. Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in Bob
happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening Bob
while we were there!” Bob
 Bob
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t Bob
meet Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered Bob
him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. Bob
 Bob
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied Bob
earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven Bob

hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, Bob
taking out that grubby little package. Had that been Bob
what the thieves were looking for? Bob
 Bob
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for Bob
dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes Bob
they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that Bob
none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as Bob
much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid Bob
collected that package just in time? Where was it Bob
now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape Bob
that he didn’t want to tell Harry? Bob

THE MIDNIGHT DUEL Bob
 Bob
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he Bob
hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Bob
Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Bob
Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put Bob
up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until Bob
they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor Bob
common room that made them all groan. Flying Bob
lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Bob
Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. Bob
 Bob
“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always Bob
wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in Bob
front of Malfoy.” Bob
 Bob
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more Bob
than anything else. Bob
 Bob
“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” Bob
said Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always Bob
going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet Bob
that’s all talk.” Bob
 Bob
Page | 160 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He Bob
complained loudly about first years never getting on Bob
the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful Bob
stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly Bob
escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only Bob
one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d Bob
spent most of his childhood zooming around the Bob
countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell Bob
anyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a Bob
hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from Bob
wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Bob
Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Bob
Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Bob
Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with Bob
only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry Bob
had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham Bob
soccer team, trying to make the players move. Bob
 Bob
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, Bob
because his grandmother had never let him near one. Bob
Privately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because Bob
Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of Bob
accidents even with both feet on the ground. Bob
 Bob
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about Bob
flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn’t Bob
learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t Bob
tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all Bob
stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library Bob
book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was Bob
hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything Bob
that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, Bob
but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s Bob
lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. Bob
 Bob
Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, Bob
something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of Bob
course. Malfoy ’s eagle owl was always bringing him Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Page | 161 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
packages of sweets from home, which he opened Bob
gloatingly at the Slytherin table. Bob
 Bob
A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his Bob
grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed Bob
them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which Bob
seemed to be full of white smoke. Bob
 Bob
“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I Bob
forget things — this tells you if there’s something Bob
you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this Bob
and if it turns red — oh ...” His face fell, because the Bob
Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “... you’ve Bob
forgotten something ...” Bob
 Bob
Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten Bob
when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor Bob
table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. Bob
 Bob
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half Bob
hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor Bob
McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any Bob
teacher in the school, was there in a flash. Bob
 Bob
“What’s going on?” Bob
 Bob
“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” Bob
 Bob
Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall Bob
back on the table. Bob
 Bob
“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Bob
Crabbe and Goyle behind him. Bob
 Bob
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the Bob
other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto Bob
the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, Bob
breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as Bob
they marched down the sloping lawns toward a Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds Bob
to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying Bob
darkly in the distance. Bob
 Bob
The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty Bob
broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry Bob
had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about Bob
the school brooms, saying that some of them started Bob
to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly Bob
to the left. Bob
 Bob
Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, Bob
gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. Bob
 Bob
“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. Bob
“Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry Bob
up.” " Bob
 Bob
Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and Bob
some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. Bob
 Bob
“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Bob
Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ” Bob
 Bob
“UP!” everyone shouted. Bob
 Bob
Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it Bob
was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had Bob
simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t Bob
moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell Bob
when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a Bob
quaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that Bob
he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. Bob
 Bob
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their Bob
brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up Bob
and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Bob
Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been Bob
doing it wrong for years. Bob

 Bob
“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the Bob
ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your Bob
brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight Bob
back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle Bob
— three — two — ” Bob
 Bob
But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of Bob
being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the Bob
whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips. Bob
 Bob
“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising Bob
straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve Bob
feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face Bob
look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, Bob
slip sideways off the broom and — Bob
 Bob
WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay Bob
facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was Bob
still rising higher and higher, and started to drift Bob
lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. Bob
 Bob
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as Bob
white as his. Bob
 Bob
“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, Bob
boy — it’s all right, up you get.” Bob
 Bob
She turned to the rest of the class. Bob
 Bob
“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the Bob
hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are Bob
or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say Bob
‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Bob
 Bob
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, Bob
hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm Bob
around him. Bob

 Bob
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst Bob
into laughter. Bob
 Bob
“Did you see his face, the great lump?” Bob
 Bob
The other Slytherins joined in. Bob
 Bob
“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil. Bob
 Bob
“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Bob
Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought Bob
you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” Bob
 Bob
“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching Bob
something out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Bob
Longbottom’s gran sent him.” Bob
 Bob
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. Bob
 Bob
“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone Bob
stopped talking to watch. Bob
 Bob
Malfoy smiled nastily. Bob
 Bob
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find Bob
— how about — up a tree?” Bob
 Bob
“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto Bob
his broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he Bob
could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost Bob
branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Bob
Potter!” Bob
 Bob
Harry grabbed his broom. Bob
 Bob
“iVo!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told Bob
us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. Bob
 Bob
He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the Bob
ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his Bob
hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in Bob
a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something Bob
he could do without being taught — this was easy, Bob
this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a Bob
little to take it even higher, and heard screams and Bob
gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring Bob
whoop from Ron. Bob
 Bob
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in Bob
midair. Malfoy looked stunned. Bob
 Bob
“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that Bob
broom!” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking Bob
worried. Bob
 Bob
Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward Bob
and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it Bob
shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got Bob
out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- Bob
face and held the broom steady. A few people below Bob
were clapping. Bob
 Bob
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Bob
Malfoy,” Harry called. Bob
 Bob
The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. Bob
 Bob
“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw Bob
the glass ball high into the air and streaked back Bob
toward the ground. Bob
 Bob
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up Bob
in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward Bob
and pointed his broom handle down — next second Bob

 Bob
he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball Bob
— wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the Bob
screams of people watching — he stretched out his Bob
hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in Bob
time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently Bob
onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in Bob
his fist. Bob
 Bob
“HARRY POTTER!” Bob
 Bob
His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor Bob
McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his Bob
feet, trembling. Bob
 Bob
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ” Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with Bob
shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare Bob
you — might have broken your neck — ” Bob
 Bob
“It wasn’t his fault, Professor — ” Bob
 Bob
“Be quiet, Miss Patil — ” Bob
 Bob
“But Malfoy — ” Bob
 Bob
“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.” Bob
 Bob
Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s Bob
triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Bob
Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the Bob
castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. Bob
 Bob
He wanted to say something to defend himself, but Bob
there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Bob
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without Bob
even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now Bob
he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be Bob
packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Bob
Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, Bob
and still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to Bob
him. She wrenched open doors and marched along Bob
corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Bob
Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He Bob
thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as Bob
gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. Bob
His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron Bob
and the others becoming wizards while he stumped Bob
around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag. Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. Bob
She opened the door and poked her head inside. Bob
 Bob
“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood Bob
for a moment?” Bob
 Bob
Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane Bob
she was going to use on him? Bob
 Bob
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year Bob
boy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking Bob
confused. Bob
 Bob
“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and Bob
they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking Bob
curiously at Harry. Bob
 Bob
“In here.” Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom Bob
that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy Bob
writing rude words on the blackboard. Bob
 Bob
“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk Bob
into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out Bob
cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door Bob
behind him and turned to face the two boys. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Bob
Seeker.” Bob
 Bob
Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to Bob
delight. Bob
 Bob
“Are you serious, Professor?” Bob
 Bob
“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The Bob
boy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was Bob
that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?” Bob
 Bob
Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was Bob
going on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and Bob
some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. Bob
 Bob
“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot Bob
dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even Bob
scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done Bob
it.” Bob
 Bob
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had Bob
come true at once. Bob
 Bob
“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked Bob
excitedly. Bob
 Bob
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor Bob
McGonagall explained. Bob
 Bob
“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now Bob
walking around Harry and staring at him. “Light — Bob
speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, Bob
Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Bob
Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” Bob
 Bob
“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we Bob
can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need Bob
a better team than last year. Flattened in that last Bob

match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in Bob
the face for weeks. ...” Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses Bob
at Harry. Bob
 Bob
“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may Bob
change my mind about punishing you.” Bob
 Bob
Then she suddenly smiled. Bob
 Bob
“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He Bob
was an excellent Quidditch player himself.” Bob
 Bob
“You’re joking.” Bob
 Bob
It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron Bob
what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Bob
Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and Bob
kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all Bob
about it. Bob
 Bob
“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must Bob
be the youngest House player in about — ” Bob
 Bob
“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his Bob
mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the Bob
excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.” Bob
 Bob
Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and Bob
gaped at Harry. Bob
 Bob
“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t Bob
tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.” Bob
 Bob
Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, Bob
spotted Harry, and hurried over. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. Bob
We’re on the team too — Beaters.” Bob
 Bob
“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for Bob
sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Bob
Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be Bob
brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost Bob
skipping when he told us.” Bob
 Bob
“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s Bob
found a new secret passageway out of the school.” Bob
 Bob
“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Bob
Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.” Bob
 Bob
Fred and George had hardly disappeared when Bob
someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked Bob
by Crabbe and Goyle. Bob
 Bob
“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the Bob
train back to the Muggles?” Bob
 Bob
“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the Bob
ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” Bob
said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all Bob
little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table Bob
was full of teachers, neither of them could do more Bob
than crack their knuckles and scowl. Bob
 Bob
“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. Bob
“Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — Bob
no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a Bob
wizard’s duel before, I suppose?” Bob
 Bob
“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m Bob
his second, who’s yours?” Bob
 Bob
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? Well meet you Bob
in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” Bob
 Bob
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each Bob
other. Bob
 Bob
“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do Bob
you mean, you’re my second?” Bob
 Bob
“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Bob
Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Bob
Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, Bob
“But people only die in proper duels, you know, with Bob
real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do Bob
is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows Bob
enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he Bob
expected you to refuse, anyway.” Bob
 Bob
“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” Bob
 Bob
“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron Bob
suggested. Bob
 Bob
“Excuse me.” Bob
 Bob
They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. Bob
 Bob
“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. Bob
 Bob
“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy Bob
were saying — ” Bob
 Bob
“Bet you could,” Ron muttered. Bob
 Bob
“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school Bob
at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if Bob

 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very Bob
selfish of you.” Bob
 Bob
“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry. Bob
“Good-bye,” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end Bob
to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later Bob
listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville Bob
wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent Bob
all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to Bob
curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t Bob
remember how to block them.” There was a very good Bob
chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Bob
Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, Bob
breaking another school rule today. On the other Bob
hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of Bob
the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Bob
Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it. Bob
 Bob
“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better Bob
go.” Bob
 Bob
They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their Bob
wands, and crept across the tower room, down the Bob
spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common Bob
room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, Bob
turning all the armchairs into hunched black Bob
shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole Bob
when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I Bob
can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.” Bob
 Bob
A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, Bob
wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. Bob
 Bob
“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, Bob
 Bob
“Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.” Bob
 Bob
Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering. Bob
 Bob
“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the Bob
portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. Bob
 Bob
Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She Bob
followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at Bob
them like an angry goose. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care Bob
about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the Bob
House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Bob
Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Bob
Spells.” Bob
 Bob
“Go away.” Bob
 Bob
“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what Bob
I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, Bob
you’re so — ” Bob
 Bob
But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione Bob
had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back Bob
inside and found herself facing an empty painting. Bob
 Bob
The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Bob
Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. Bob
 Bob
“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly. Bob
 Bob
“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, Bob
we’re going to be late.” Bob
 Bob
They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor Bob
when Hermione caught up with them. Bob
 Bob
“I’m coming with you,” she said. Bob
 Bob
Page | 174 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“You are not.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Bob
Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell Bob
him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you Bob
can back me up.” Bob
 Bob
“You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly. Bob
 Bob
“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard Bob
something.” Bob
 Bob
It was a sort of snuffling. Bob
 Bob
“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the Bob
dark. Bob
 Bob
It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up Bob
on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake Bob
as they crept nearer. Bob
 Bob
“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for Bob
hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get Bob
in to bed.” Bob
 Bob
“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig Bob
snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone Bob
off somewhere.” Bob
 Bob
“How’s your arm?” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey Bob
mended it in about a minute.” Bob
 Bob
“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be Bob
somewhere, we’ll see you later — ” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, Bob
 Bob
“I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s Bob
been past twice already.” Bob
 Bob
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Bob
Hermione and Neville. Bob
 Bob
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve Bob
learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us Bob
about, and used it on you.” Bob
 Bob
Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron Bob
exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry Bob
hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all Bob
forward. Bob
 Bob
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of Bob
moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry Bob
expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they Bob
were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor Bob
and tiptoed toward the trophy room. Bob
 Bob
Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal Bob
trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught Bob
them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver Bob
and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, Bob
keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the Bob
room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in Bob
and started at once. The minutes crept by. Bob
 Bob
“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered. Bob
 Bob
Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Bob
 Bob
Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard Bob
someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy. Bob
 Bob
“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a Bob
corner.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Bob
Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as Bob
quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the Bob
door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had Bob
barely whipped round the corner when they heard Bob
Filch enter the trophy room. Bob
 Bob
“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, Bob
“probably hiding.” Bob
 Bob
“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, Bob
petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full Bob
of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting Bob
nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak Bob
and broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed Ron Bob
around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right Bob
into a suit of armor. Bob
 Bob
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the Bob
whole castle. Bob
 Bob
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted Bob
down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Bob
Filch was following — they swung around the Bob
doorpost and galloped down one corridor then Bob
another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where Bob
they were or where they were going — they ripped Bob
through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden Bob
passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Bob
Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from Bob
the trophy room. Bob
 Bob
“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against Bob
the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was Bob
bent double, wheezing and spluttering. Bob
 Bob
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the Bob
stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, Bob
“quickly as possible.” Bob
 Bob
“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You Bob
realize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet Bob
you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the Bob
trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.” Bob
 Bob
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t Bob
going to tell her that. Bob
 Bob
“Let’s go.” Bob
 Bob
It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone Bob
more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled Bob
and something came shooting out of a classroom in Bob
front of them. Bob
 Bob
It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a Bob
squeal of delight. Bob
 Bob
“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown Bob
out.” Bob
 Bob
Peeves cackled. Bob
 Bob
“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, Bob
tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” Bob
 Bob
“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” Bob
 Bob
“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity Bob
voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your Bob
own good, you know.” Bob
 Bob
“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Bob
Peeves — this was a big mistake. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, Bob
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS Bob
CORRIDOR!” Bob
 Bob
Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right Bob
to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a Bob
door — and it was locked. Bob
 Bob
“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at Bob
the door, “We’re done for! This is the end!” Bob
 Bob
They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he Bob
could toward Peeves ’s shouts. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Bob
Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, Bob
“Alohomora\” Bob
 Bob
The lock clicked and the door swung open — they Bob
piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their Bob
ears against it, listening. Bob
 Bob
“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. Bob
“Quick, tell me.” Bob
 Bob
“Say ‘please.’ ” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?” Bob
 Bob
“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Bob
Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. Bob
 Bob
“All right — please.” Bob
 Bob
“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing Bob
if you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they Bob
heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch Bob
cursing in rage. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I Bob
think well be okay — get off Neville!” For Neville had Bob
been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the Bob
last minute. “What?” Bob
 Bob
Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. Bob
For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a Bob
nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything Bob
that had happened so far. Bob
 Bob
They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They Bob
were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third Bob
floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. Bob
 Bob
They were looking straight into the eyes of a Bob
monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space Bob
between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three Bob
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and Bob
quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, Bob
saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. Bob
 Bob
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, Bob
and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t Bob
already dead was that their sudden appearance had Bob
taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over Bob
that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous Bob
growls meant. Bob
 Bob
Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and Bob
death, he’d take Filch. Bob
 Bob
They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, Bob
and they ran, they almost flew, back down the Bob
corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them Bob
somewhere else, because they didn’t see him Bob
anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to Bob
do was put as much space as possible between them Bob
and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh Bob
floor. Bob
 Bob
“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, Bob
looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders Bob
and their flushed, sweaty faces. Bob
 Bob
“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Bob
Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They Bob
scrambled into the common room and collapsed, Bob
trembling, into armchairs. Bob
 Bob
It was a while before any of them said anything. Bob
Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again. Bob
 Bob
“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing Bob
like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If Bob
any dog needs exercise, that one does.” Bob
 Bob
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad Bob
temper back again. Bob
 Bob
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she Bob
snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” Bob
 Bob
“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its Bob
feet, I was too busy with its heads.” Bob
 Bob
“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s Bob
obviously guarding something.” Bob
 Bob
She stood up, glaring at them. Bob
 Bob
“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all Bob
have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you Bob
don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” Bob
 Bob
Ron stared after her, his mouth open. Bob

“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged Bob
her along, wouldn’t you?” Bob
 Bob
But Hermione had given Harry something else to Bob
think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was Bob
guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said? Bob
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for Bob
something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Bob
Hogwarts. Bob
 Bob
It looked as though Harry had found out where the Bob
grubby little package from vault seven hundred and Bob
thirteen was. Bob

HALLOWEEN Bob
 Bob
Malfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Bob
Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, Bob
looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the Bob
next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting Bob
the three-headed dog had been an excellent Bob
adventure, and they were quite keen to have another Bob
one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the Bob
package that seemed to have been moved from Bob
Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time Bob
wondering what could possibly need such heavy Bob
protection. Bob
 Bob
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Bob
Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Or both,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious Bob
object was that it was about two inches long, they Bob
didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was Bob
without further clues. Bob

 Bob
 Bob
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest Bob
interest in what lay underneath the dog and the Bob
trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near Bob
the dog again. Bob
 Bob
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Bob
Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they Bob
saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted Bob
now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their Bob
great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail Bob
about a week later. Bob
 Bob
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, Bob
everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, Bob
thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry Bob
was just as interested as everyone else to see what Bob
was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the Bob
owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, Bob
knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly Bob
fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a Bob
letter on top of the parcel. Bob
 Bob
Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, Bob
because it said: Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. Bob
 Bob
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I Bob
don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a Bob
broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will Bob
meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven Bob
o’clock for your first training session. Bob
 Bob
Professor M. McGonagall Bob
 Bob
Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the Bob
note to Ron to read. Bob

 Bob
“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. Bob
“I’ve never even touched one.” Bob
 Bob
They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the Bob
broomstick in private before their first class, but Bob
halfway across the entrance hall they found the way Bob
upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized Bob
the package from Harry and felt it. Bob
 Bob
“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Bob
Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. Bob
“You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t Bob
allowed them.” Bob
 Bob
Ron couldn’t resist it. Bob
 Bob
“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Bob
Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Bob
Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. Bob
“Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same Bob
league as the Nimbus.” Bob
 Bob
“What would you know about it, Weasley, you Bob
couldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. Bob
“I suppose you and your brothers have to save up Bob
twig by twig.” Bob
 Bob
Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared Bob
at Malfoy’s elbow. Bob
 Bob
“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked. Bob
 Bob
“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Bob
Malfoy quickly. Bob
 Bob
“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, Bob
beaming at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all Bob
about the special circumstances, Potter. And what Bob
model is it?” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting Bob
not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. Bob
“And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” Bob
he added. Bob
 Bob
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their Bob
laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion. Bob
 Bob
“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the Bob
top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Bob
Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team. ...” Bob
 Bob
“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking Bob
rules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. Bob
Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking Bob
disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand. Bob
 Bob
“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so Bob
much good.” Bob
 Bob
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. Bob
 Bob
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his Bob
lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the Bob
dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under Bob
his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where Bob
he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his Bob
dinner that evening without noticing what he was Bob
eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap Bob
the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. Bob
 Bob
“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Bob
Harry’s bedspread. Bob
 Bob
Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different Bob
brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and Bob
shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand Bob
written in gold near the top. Bob
 Bob
As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and Bob
set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d Bob
never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of Bob
seats were raised in stands around the field so that Bob
the spectators were high enough to see what was Bob
going on. At either end of the field were three golden Bob
poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of Bob
the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles Bob
through, except that they were fifty feet high. Bob
 Bob
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry Bob
mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the Bob
ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of Bob
the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. Bob
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he Bob
wanted at his lightest touch. Bob
 Bob
“Hey, Potter, come down!” Bob
 Bob
Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large Bob
wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to Bob
him. Bob
 Bob
“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what Bob
McGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I’m Bob
just going to teach you the rules this evening, then Bob
you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” Bob
 Bob
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized Bob
balls. Bob
 Bob
“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to Bob
understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are Bob
seven players on each side. Three of them are called Bob
Chasers.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a Bob
bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. Bob
 Bob
“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Bob
Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and Bob
get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten Bob
points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the Bob
hoops. Follow me?” Bob
 Bob
“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through Bob
the hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of Bob
like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t Bob
it?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously. Bob
 Bob
“Never mind,” said Harry quickly. Bob
 Bob
“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called Bob
the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly Bob
around our hoops and stop the other team from Bob
scoring.” Bob
 Bob
“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was Bob
determined to remember it all. “And they play with Bob
the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He Bob
pointed at the three balls left inside the box. Bob
 Bob
“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.” Bob
 Bob
He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short Bob
baseball bat. Bob
 Bob
“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood Bob
said. “These two are the Bludgers.” Bob
 Bob
He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and Bob
slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Page | 188 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps Bob
holding them inside the box. Bob
 Bob
“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and Bob
freed one of the Bludgers. Bob
 Bob
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then Bob
pelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with Bob
the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it Bob
zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their Bob
heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it Bob
and managed to pin it to the ground. Bob
 Bob
“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger Bob
back into the crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bob
Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off Bob
their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on Bob
each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their Bob
job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and Bob
knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve Bob
got all that?” Bob
 Bob
“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Bob
Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bob
Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off. Bob
 Bob
“Very good,” said Wood. Bob
 Bob
“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry Bob
asked, hoping he sounded offhand. Bob
 Bob
“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken Bob
jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last Bob
member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And Bob
you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bob
Bludgers — ” Bob
 Bob
“ — unless they crack my head open.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Page | 189 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for Bob
the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bob
Bludgers themselves.” Bob
 Bob
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth Bob
and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bob
Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. Bob
It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver Bob
wings. Bob
 Bob
“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the Bob
most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch Bob
because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the Bob
Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out Bob
of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get Bob
it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Bob
Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra Bob
hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. Bob
That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Bob
Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it Bob
can go on for ages — I think the record is three Bob
months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so Bob
the players could get some sleep. Bob
 Bob
“Well, that’s it — any questions?” Bob
 Bob
Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to Bob
do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the Bob
problem. Bob
 Bob
“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, Bob
carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too Bob
dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of Bob
these.” Bob
 Bob
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket Bob
and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the Bob
air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could Bob
in every direction for Harry to catch. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was Bob
delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen Bob
and they couldn’t carry on. Bob
 Bob
“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” Bob
said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the Bob
castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better Bob
than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for Bob
England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” Bob
 Bob
Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what Bob
with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top Bob
of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it Bob
when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts Bob
two months. The castle felt more like home than Bob
Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming Bob
more and more interesting now that they had Bob
mastered the basics. Bob
 Bob
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious Bob
smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the Bob
corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced Bob
in Charms that he thought they were ready to start Bob
making objects fly, something they had all been dying Bob
to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom Bob
around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the Bob
class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Bob
Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville Bob
had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was Bob
to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to Bob
tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. Bob
She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Bob
Harry’s broomstick had arrived. Bob
 Bob
“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve Bob
been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, Bob
perched on top of his pile of books as usual. “Swish Bob
and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the Bob
magic words properly is very important, too — never Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f and Bob
found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his Bob
chest.” Bob
 Bob
It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and Bob
flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be Bob
sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got Bob
so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set Bob
fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat. Bob
 Bob
Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more Bob
luck. Bob
 Bob
“Wingardium Leviosal” he shouted, waving his long Bob
arms like a windmill. Bob
 Bob
“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. Bob
“It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and Bob
long.” Bob
 Bob
“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled. Bob
 Bob
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked Bob
her wand, and said, “Wingardium LeviosaV’ Bob
 Bob
Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four Bob
feet above their heads. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. Bob
“Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!” Bob
 Bob
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. Bob
 Bob
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Bob
Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded Bob
corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past Bob
him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her Bob
face — and was startled to see that she was in tears. Bob
 Bob
“I think she heard you.” Bob
 Bob
“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. Bob
“She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.” Bob
 Bob
Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t Bob
seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Bob
Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Bob
Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione Bob
was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be Bob
left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but Bob
a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, Bob
where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of Bob
their minds. Bob
 Bob
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and Bob
ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the Bob
tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the Bob
pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on Bob
the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term Bob
banquet. Bob
 Bob
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato Bob
when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, Bob
his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone Bob
stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, Bob
slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in Bob
the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” Bob
 Bob
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. Bob
 Bob
There was an uproar. It took several purple Bob
firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Bob
Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the Bob
dormitories immediately!” Bob
 Bob
Percy was in his element. Bob
 Bob
“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear Bob
the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind Bob
me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Bob
Excuse me, I’m a prefect!” Bob
 Bob
“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they Bob
climbed the stairs. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” Bob
said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween Bob
joke.” Bob
 Bob
They passed different groups of people hurrying in Bob
different directions. As they jostled their way through Bob
a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly Bob
grabbed Ron’s arm. Bob
 Bob
“I’ve just thought — Hermione.” Bob
 Bob
“What about her?” Bob
 Bob
“She doesn’t know about the troll.” Bob
 Bob
Ron bit his lip. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not Bob
see us.” Bob
 Bob
Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the Bob
other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and Bob
hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They had just Bob
turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps Bob
behind them. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large Bob
stone griffin. Bob
 Bob
Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Bob
Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from Bob
view. Bob
 Bob
“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he Bob
down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” Bob
 Bob
“Search me.” Bob
 Bob
Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor Bob
after Snape ’s fading footsteps. Bob
 Bob
“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron Bob
held up his hand. Bob
 Bob
“Can you smell something?” Bob
 Bob
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a Bob
mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no Bob
one seems to clean. Bob
 Bob
And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the Bob
shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at Bob
the end of a passage to the left, something huge was Bob
moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows Bob
and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. Bob
 Bob
It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a Bob
dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder Bob
with its small bald head perched on top like a Bob
coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with Bob
flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was Bob
incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which Bob
dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. Bob
It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then Bob
slouched slowly into the room. Bob
 Bob
“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could Bob
lock it in.” Bob
 Bob
“Good idea,” said Ron nervously. Bob
 Bob
They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, Bob
praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With Bob
one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam Bob
the door, and lock it. Bob
 Bob
“Yes!” Bob
 Bob
Flushed with their victory, they started to run back Bob
up the passage, but as they reached the corner they Bob
heard something that made their hearts stop — a Bob
high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the Bob
chamber they’d just chained up. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. Bob
 Bob
“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped. Bob
 Bob
“ Hermionel” they said together. Bob
 Bob
It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what Bob
choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted Bob
back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their Bob
panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran Bob
inside. Bob
 Bob
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall Bob
opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll Bob
was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the Bob
walls as it went. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, Bob
seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against Bob
the wall. Bob
 Bob
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It Bob
lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had Bob
made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It Bob
hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club Bob
as it went. Bob
 Bob
“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the Bob
chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll Bob
didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its Bob
shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, Bob
turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Bob
Harry time to run around it. Bob
 Bob
“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying Bob
to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, Bob
she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open Bob
with terror. Bob
 Bob
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the Bob
troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, Bob
who was nearest and had no way to escape. Bob
 Bob
Harry then did something that was both very brave Bob
and very stupid: He took a great running jump and Bob
managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck Bob
from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging Bob
there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit Bob
of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been Bob
in his hand when he’d jumped — it had gone straight Bob
up one of the troll’s nostrils. Bob
 Bob
Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its Bob
club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, Bob
the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a Bob
terrible blow with the club. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled Bob
out his own wand — not knowing what he was going Bob
to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came Bob
into his head: “Wingardium Leviosal” Bob
 Bob
The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose Bob
high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and Bob
dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s Bob
head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat Bob
on its face, with a thud that made the whole room Bob
tremble. Bob
 Bob
Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of Bob
breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still Bob
raised, staring at what he had done. Bob
 Bob
It was Hermione who spoke first. Bob
 Bob
“Is it — dead?” Bob
 Bob
“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been Bob
knocked out.” Bob
 Bob
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s Bob
nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray Bob
glue. Bob
 Bob
“Urgh — troll boogers.” Bob
 Bob
He wiped it on the troll’s trousers. Bob
 Bob
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the Bob
three of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a Bob
racket they had been making, but of course, someone Bob
downstairs must have heard the crashes and the Bob
troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall Bob
had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Bob
Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell Bob
 Bob

 Bob
took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and Bob
sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. Bob
 Bob
Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was Bob
looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her Bob
look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning Bob
fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s Bob
mind. Bob
 Bob
“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor Bob
McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked Bob
at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the Bob
air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you Bob
in your dormitory?” Bob
 Bob
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked Bob
at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. Bob
 Bob
Then a small voice came out of the shadows. Bob
 Bob
“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for Bob
me.” Bob
 Bob
“Miss Granger!” Bob
 Bob
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. Bob

“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I Bob
could deal with it on my own — you know, because Bob
I’ve read all about them.” Bob
 Bob
Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a Bob
downright lie to a teacher? Bob
 Bob
“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry Bob
stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out Bob
with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and Bob
fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they Bob
arrived.” Bob

Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story Bob
wasn’t new to them. Bob
 Bob
“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, Bob
staring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you Bob
foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a Bob
mountain troll on your own?” Bob
 Bob
Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Bob
Hermione was the last person to do anything against Bob
the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to Bob
get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started Bob
handing out sweets. Bob
 Bob
“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Bob
Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m Bob
very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all, Bob
you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are Bob
finishing the feast in their Houses.” Bob
 Bob
Hermione left. Bob
 Bob
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first Bob
years could have taken on a full-grown mountain Bob
troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Bob
Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.” Bob
 Bob
They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at Bob
all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief Bob
to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from Bob
anything else. Bob
 Bob
“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron Bob
grumbled. Bob
 Bob
“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione ’s.” Bob

“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron Bob
admitted. “Mind you, we did save her.” Bob
 Bob
“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t Bob
locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him. Bob
 Bob
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. Bob
 Bob
“Pig snout,” they said and entered. Bob
 Bob
The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone Bob
was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, Bob
however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. Bob
There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of Bob
them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” Bob
and hurried off to get plates. Bob
 Bob
But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became Bob
their friend. There are some things you can’t share Bob
without ending up liking each other, and knocking Bob
out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. Bob

QUIDDITCH Bob
 Bob
As they entered November, the weather turned very Bob
cold. The mountains around the school became icy Bob
gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the Bob
ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen Bob
from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on Bob
the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin Bob
overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin Bob
boots. Bob
 Bob
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry Bob
would be playing in his first match after weeks of Bob
training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor Bob
won, they would move up into second place in the Bob
House Championship. Bob
 Bob
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood Bob
had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry Bob
should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was Bob
playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry Bob
didn’t know which was worse — people telling him Bob
he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be Bob
running around underneath him holding a mattress. Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a Bob
friend. He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through Bob
all his homework without her, what with all the last- Bob
minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them Bob
do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, Bob
which turned out to be a very interesting read. Bob
 Bob
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of Bob
committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had Bob
happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Bob
Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, Bob
and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to Bob
happen to them; that although people rarely died Bob
playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish Bob
and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. Bob
 Bob
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about Bob
breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her Bob
from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for Bob
it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the Bob
three of them were out in the freezing courtyard Bob
during break, and she had conjured them up a bright Bob
blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. Bob
They were standing with their backs to it, getting Bob
warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at Bob
once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Bob
Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from Bob
view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. Bob
Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces Bob
caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen Bob
the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to Bob
tell them off anyway. Bob
 Bob
“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?” Bob
 Bob
It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“Library books are not to be taken outside the Bob
school,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from Bob
Gryffindor.” Bob
 Bob
“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily Bob
as Snape limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with Bob
his leg?” Bob
 Bob
“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron Bob
bitterly. Bob
 Bob
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that Bob
evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next Bob
to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Bob
Charms homework for them. She would never let Bob
them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her Bob
to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. Bob
 Bob
Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Bob
Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about Bob
tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting Bob
up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Bob
Snape if he could have it. Bob
 Bob
“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry Bob
had an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were Bob
other teachers listening. Bob
 Bob
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. Bob
There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. Bob
 Bob
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was Bob
worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered Bob
inside — and a horrible scene met his eyes. Bob
 Bob
Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was Bob
holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was Bob
bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape Bob
bandages. Bob

 Bob
 Bob
“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you Bob
supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at Bob
once?” Bob
 Bob
Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — Bob
 Bob
“POTTER!” Bob
 Bob
Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his Bob
robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. Bob
 Bob
“I just wondered if I could have my book back.” Bob
 Bob
“GET OUT! OUT!” Bob
 Bob
Harry left, before Snape could take any more points Bob
from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. Bob
 Bob
“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. Bob
“What’s the matter?” Bob
 Bob
In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen. Bob
 Bob
“You know what this means?” he finished Bob
breathlessly. “He tried to get past that three-headed Bob
dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we Bob
saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d Bob
bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a Bob
diversion!” Bob
 Bob
Hermione’s eyes were wide. Bob
 Bob
“No — he wouldn’t,” she said. “I know he’s not very Bob
nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something Bob
Dumbledore was keeping safe.” Bob
 Bob
“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints Bob
or something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he Bob
after? What’s that dog guarding?” Bob
 Bob
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the Bob
same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry Bob
couldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he Bob
needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch Bob
match in a few hours — but the expression on Bob
Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy Bob
to forget. Bob
 Bob
The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Bob
Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried Bob
sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking Bob
forward to a good Quidditch match. Bob
 Bob
“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.” Bob
 Bob
“I don’t want anything.” Bob
 Bob
“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“I’m not hungry.” Bob
 Bob
Harry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking Bob
onto the field. Bob
 Bob
“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Bob
Finnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get Bob
clobbered by the other team.” Bob
 Bob
“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile Bob
ketchup on his sausages. Bob
 Bob
By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out Bob
in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many Bob
students had binoculars. The seats might be raised Bob
high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what Bob
was going on sometimes. Bob

Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean Bob
the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Bob
Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the Bob
sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for Bob
President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had Bob
done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Bob
Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that Bob
the paint flashed different colors. Bob
 Bob
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of Bob
the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch Bob
robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) . Bob
 Bob
Wood cleared his throat for silence. Bob
 Bob
“Okay, men,” he said. Bob
 Bob
“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson. Bob
 Bob
“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.” Bob
 Bob
“The big one,” said Fred Weasley. Bob
 Bob
“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George. Bob
 Bob
“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, Bob
“we were on the team last year.” Bob
 Bob
“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Bob
Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know Bob
it.” Bob
 Bob
He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.” Bob
 Bob
“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.” Bob
 Bob
Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker Bob
room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, Bob
walked onto the field to loud cheers. Bob

 Bob
Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the Bob
middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her Bob
broom in her hand. Bob
 Bob
“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, Bob
once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed Bob
that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Bob
Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry Bob
thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in Bob
him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering Bob
banner high above, flashing Potter for President over Bob
the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. Bob
 Bob
“Mount your brooms, please.” Bob
 Bob
Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. Bob
 Bob
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. Bob
 Bob
Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They Bob
were off. Bob
 Bob
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Bob
Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser Bob
that girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” Bob
 Bob
“JORDAN!” Bob
 Bob
“Sorry, Professor.” Bob
 Bob
The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the Bob
commentary for the match, closely watched by Bob
Professor McGonagall. Bob
 Bob
“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass Bob
to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last Bob
year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the Bob
Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Bob

flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc- no, Bob
stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Bob
Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Bob
Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive Bob
around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that Bob
must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bob
Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Bob
Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but Bob
he’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Bob
Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play Bob
by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back Bob
in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and Bob
off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bob
Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Bob
Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — Bob
GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” Bob
 Bob
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and Bob
moans from the Slytherins. Bob
 Bob
“Budge up there, move along.” Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid!” Bob
 Bob
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid Bob
enough space to join them. Bob
 Bob
“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a Bob
large pair of binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t Bob
the same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch Bob
yet, eh?” Bob
 Bob
“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” Bob
 Bob
“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Bob
Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at Bob
the speck that was Harry. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, Bob
squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was Bob
part of his and Wood’s game plan. Bob
 Bob
“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Bob
Snitch,” Wood had said. “We don’t want you attacked Bob
before you have to be.” Bob
 Bob
When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple Bob
of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was Bob
back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught Bob
sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection Bob
from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bob
Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a Bob
cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Bob
Fred Weasley came chasing after it. Bob
 Bob
“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he Bob
beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. Bob
 Bob
“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, Bob
“Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, Bob
and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a Bob
moment — was that the Snitch?” Bob
 Bob
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey Bob
dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his Bob
shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left Bob
ear. Bob
 Bob
Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived Bob
downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Bob
Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they Bob
hurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed Bob
to have forgotten what they were supposed to be Bob
doing as they hung in midair to watch. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little Bob
round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he Bob
put on an extra spurt of speed — Bob
 Bob
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors Bob
below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, Bob
and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on Bob
for dear life. Bob
 Bob
“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors. Bob
 Bob
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered Bob
a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all Bob
the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had Bob
disappeared from sight again. Bob
 Bob
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send Bob
him off, ref! Red card!” Bob
 Bob
“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get Bob
shown the red card and you’re out of the game!” Bob
 Bob
“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid, however, was on Dean’s side. Bob
 Bob
“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Bob
Harry outta the air.” Bob
 Bob
Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. Bob
 Bob
“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of Bob
cheating — ” Bob
 Bob
“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall. Bob
 Bob
“I mean, after that open and revolting foul — ” Bob
 Bob
Page | 211 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Jordan, I’m warning you — ” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Bob
Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a Bob
penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it Bob
away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor Bob
still in possession.” Bob
 Bob
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went Bob
spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. Bob
His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a Bob
split second, he thought he was going to fall. He Bob
gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and Bob
knees. He’d never felt anything like that. Bob
 Bob
It happened again. It was as though the broom was Bob
trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands Bob
did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry Bob
tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts — Bob
he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — Bob
and then he realized that his broom was completely Bob
out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t Bob
direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and Bob
every now and then making violent swishing Bob
movements that almost unseated him. Bob
 Bob
Lee was still commentating. Bob
 Bob
“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — Bob
passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face Bob
by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Bob
Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...” Bob
 Bob
The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have Bob
noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It Bob
was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, Bob
jerking and twitching as it went. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid Bob
mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. “If I Bob
didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his Bob
broom ... but he can’t have. ...” Bob
 Bob
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over Bob
the stands. His broom had started to roll over and Bob
over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then Bob
the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a Bob
wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling Bob
from it, holding on with only one hand. Bob
 Bob
“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” Bob
Seamus whispered. Bob
 Bob
“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t Bob
nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Bob
Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Bob
Thousand.” Bob
 Bob
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid ’s binoculars, Bob
but instead of looking up at Harry, she started Bob
looking frantically at the crowd. Bob
 Bob
“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced. Bob
 Bob
“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.” Bob
 Bob
Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle Bob
of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Bob
Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. Bob
 Bob
“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Bob
Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“What should we do?” Bob
 Bob
“Leave it to me.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had Bob
disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Bob
Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost Bob
impossible for him to hang on much longer. The Bob
whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Bob
Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one Bob
of their brooms, but it was no good — every time they Bob
got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They Bob
dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously Bob
hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Bob
Quaffle and scored five times without anyone Bob
noticing. Bob
 Bob
“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately. Bob
 Bob
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand Bob
where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row Bob
behind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she Bob
knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in Bob
front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled Bob
out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen Bob
words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto Bob
the hem of Snape ’s robes. Bob
 Bob
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize Bob
that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had Bob
done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar Bob
in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Bob
Snape would never know what had happened. Bob
 Bob
It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able Bob
to clamber back on to his broom. Bob
 Bob
“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been Bob
sobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes. Bob
 Bob
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the Bob
crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours Bob
— coughed — and something gold fell into his hand. Bob
 Bob
“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his Bob
head, and the game ended in complete confusion. Bob
 Bob
“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was Bob
still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no Bob
difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Bob
Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Bob
Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy Bob
points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He Bob
was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s Bob
hut, with Ron and Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I Bob
saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, Bob
he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.” Bob
 Bob
“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of Bob
what had gone on next to him in the stands. “Why Bob
would Snape do somethin’ like that?” Bob
 Bob
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, Bob
wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the Bob
truth. Bob
 Bob
“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. Bob
“He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Bob
Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal Bob
whatever it’s guarding.” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid dropped the teapot. Bob
 Bob
“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said. Bob
 Bob
“ Fluffy ?” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie Bob

to guard the — ” Bob
 Bob
“Yes?” said Harry eagerly. Bob
 Bob
“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. Bob
“That’s top secret, that is.” Bob
 Bob
“But Snape’s trying to steal it.” Bob
 Bob
“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts Bob
teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.” Bob
 Bob
“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Bob
Hermione. Bob
 Bob
The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have Bob
changed her mind about Snape. Bob
 Bob
“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all Bob
about them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Bob
Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!” Bob
 Bob
“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ Bob
know why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape Bob
wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all Bob
three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ Bob
concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ Bob
you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Bob
Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel — ■” Bob
 Bob
“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Bob
Flamel involved, is there?” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid looked furious with himself. Bob

THE MIRROR OF ERISED Bob
 Bob
Christmas was coming. One morning in mid- Bob
December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in Bob
several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Bob
Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several Bob
snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, Bob
bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that Bob
managed to battle their way through the stormy sky Bob
to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Bob
Hagrid before they could fly off again. Bob
 Bob
No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Bob
Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had Bob
roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and Bob
a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Bob
Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in Bob
the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist Bob
before them and they kept as close as possible to Bob
their hot cauldrons. Bob
 Bob
“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions Bob
class, “for all those people who have to stay at Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted Bob
at home.” Bob
 Bob
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Bob
Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out Bob
powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had Bob
been even more unpleasant than usual since the Bob
Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had Bob
lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a Bob
wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Bob
Seeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found Bob
this funny, because they were all so impressed at the Bob
way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking Bob
broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone Bob
back to taunting Harry about having no proper Bob
family. Bob
 Bob
It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Bob
Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come Bob
around the week before, making a list of students Bob
who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had Bob
signed up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at Bob
all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d Bob
ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, Bob
because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania Bob
to visit Charlie. Bob
 Bob
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, Bob
they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Bob
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a Bob
loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind Bob
it. Bob
 Bob
“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his Bob
head through the branches. Bob
 Bob
“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Bob
Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. “Are you trying Bob
to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be Bob
gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I Bob
suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a Bob
palace compared to what your family’s used to.” Bob
 Bob
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. Bob
 Bob
“WEASLEY!” Bob
 Bob
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes. Bob
 Bob
“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, Bob
sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. Bob
“Malfoy was insultin’ his family.” Bob
 Bob
“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Bob
Hagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from Bob
Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more. Bob
Move along, all of you.” Bob
 Bob
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the Bob
tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. Bob
 Bob
“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s Bob
back, “one of these days, I’ll get him — ” Bob
 Bob
“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” Bob
 Bob
“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Bob
Hagrid. “Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Bob
Great Hall, looks a treat.” Bob
 Bob
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off Bob
to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Bob
Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas Bob
decorations. Bob

 Bob
 Bob
“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, Bob
would you?” Bob
 Bob
The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and Bob
mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than Bob
twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the Bob
room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering Bob
with hundreds of candles. Bob
 Bob
“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Bob
Hagrid asked. Bob
 Bob
“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — Bob
Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we Bob
should be in the library.” Bob
 Bob
“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes Bob
away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden Bob
bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing Bob
them over the branches of the new tree. Bob
 Bob
“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the Bob
hall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. Bob
 Bob
“Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been Bob
trying to find out who he is.” Bob
 Bob
“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — Bob
I’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that Bob
dog’s guardin’.” Bob
 Bob
“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s Bob
all,” said Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” Bob
Harry added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of Bob
books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name Bob
somewhere.” Bob
 Bob
“I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly. Bob
 Bob
“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, Bob
and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried Bob
off to the library. Bob
 Bob
They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s Bob
name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how Bob
else were they going to find out what Snape was Bob
trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to Bob
know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might Bob
have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t in Bob
Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Bob
Magical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from Bob
Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Bob
Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of Bob
course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of Bob
thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds Bob
of narrow rows. Bob
 Bob
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had Bob
decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of Bob
books and started pulling them off the shelves at Bob
random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Bob
Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel Bob
wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you Bob
needed a specially signed note from one of the Bob
teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he Bob
knew he’d never get one. These were the books Bob
containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Bob
Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying Bob
advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. Bob
 Bob
“What are you looking for, boy?” Bob
 Bob
“Nothing,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather Bob
duster at him. Bob
 Bob
“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!” Bob
 Bob
Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some Bob
story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione Bob
had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam Bob
Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure Bob
she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk Bob
Snape hearing what they were up to. Bob
 Bob
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other Bob
two had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. Bob
They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as Bob
they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t Bob
surprising they’d found nothing. What they really Bob
needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince Bob
breathing down their necks. Bob
 Bob
Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, Bob
shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. Bob
 Bob
“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” Bob
said Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find Bob
anything.” Bob
 Bob
“And you could ask your parents if they know who Bob
Flamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.” Bob
 Bob
“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione. Bob
 Bob
Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were Bob
having too good a time to think much about Flamel. Bob
They had the dormitory to themselves and the Bob
common room was far emptier than usual, so they Bob
were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They Bob
sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a Bob
toasting fork — bread, English muffins, Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy Bob
expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they Bob
wouldn’t work. Bob
 Bob
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This Bob
was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures Bob
were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in Bob
battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like Bob
everything else he owned, it had once belonged to Bob
someone else in his family — in this case, his Bob
grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a Bob
drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had Bob
trouble getting them to do what he wanted. Bob
 Bob
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had Bob
lent him, and they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a Bob
very good player yet and they kept shouting different Bob
bits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t Bob
send me there, can’t you see his knight? Send him, we Bob
can afford to lose him.” Bob
 Bob
On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward Bob
to the next day for the food and the fun, but not Bob
expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in Bob
the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a Bob
small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. Bob
 Bob
“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry Bob
scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. Bob
 Bob
“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got Bob
some presents!” Bob
 Bob
“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to Bob
his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s. Bob
 Bob
Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in Bob
thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Bob
Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden Bob
 Bob

 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry Bob
blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl. Bob
 Bob
A second, very small parcel contained a note. Bob
 Bob
We received your message and enclose your Christmas Bob
present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped Bob
to the note was a fifty-pence piece. Bob
 Bob
“That’s friendly,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. Bob
 Bob
“ Weird\ ” he said, “What a shape! This is money?” Bob
 Bob
“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how Bob
pleased Ron was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — Bob
so who sent these?” Bob
 Bob
“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, Bob
turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy Bob
parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any Bob
presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you Bob
a Weasley sweater.” Bob
 Bob
Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand- Bob
knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of Bob
homemade fudge. Bob
 Bob
“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, Bob
unwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.” Bob
 Bob
“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the Bob
fudge, which was very tasty. Bob
 Bob
His next present also contained candy — a large box Bob
of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. Bob

 Bob
 Bob
This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt Bob
it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. Bob
 Bob
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the Bob
floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. Bob
 Bob
“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, Bob
dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten Bob
from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is — they’re Bob
really rare, and really valuable.” Bob
 Bob
“What is it?” Bob
 Bob
Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It Bob
was strange to the touch, like water woven into Bob
material. Bob
 Bob
“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on Bob
his face. “I’m sure it is — try it on.” Bob
 Bob
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron Bob
gave a yell. Bob
 Bob
“It is! Look down!” Bob
 Bob
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He Bob
dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection Bob
looked back at him, just his head suspended in Bob
midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the Bob
cloak over his head and his reflection vanished Bob
completely. Bob
 Bob
“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of Bob
it!” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Bob
Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen Bob
before were the following words: Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Page | 225 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Your father left this in my possession before he died. It Bob
is time it was returned to you. Bob
 Bob
Use it well. Bob
 Bob
A Very Merry Christmas to you. Bob
 Bob
There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron Bob
was admiring the cloak. Bob
 Bob
“I’d give anuthinq for one of these,” he said. “Anuthinq. Bob
What’s the matter?” Bob
 Bob
“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had Bob
sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his Bob
father? Bob
 Bob
Before he could say or think anything else, the Bob
dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Bob
Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly Bob
out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone Bob
else yet. Bob
 Bob
“Merry Christmas!” Bob
 Bob
“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” Bob
 Bob
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one Bob
with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. Bob
 Bob
“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, Bob
holding up Harry’s sweater. “She obviously makes Bob
more of an effort if you’re not family.” Bob
 Bob
“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George Bob
demanded. “Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and Bob
warm.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he Bob
pulled it over his head. Bob
 Bob
“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. Bob
 Bob
“I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But Bob
we’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and Bob
Forge.” Bob
 Bob
“What’s all this noise?” Bob
 Bob
Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, Bob
looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway Bob
through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a Bob
lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. Bob
 Bob
“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all Bob
wearing ours, even Harry got one.” Bob
 Bob
“I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins Bob
forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses Bob
askew. Bob
 Bob
“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, Bob
either,” said George. “Christmas is a time for family.” Bob
 Bob
They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms Bob
pinned to his side by his sweater. Bob
 Bob
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas Bob
dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of Bob
roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; Bob
tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich Bob
gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard Bob
crackers every few feet along the table. These Bob
fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Bob
Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their Bob
little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Bob
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t Bob
just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from Bob
the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several Bob
live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore Bob
had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered Bob
bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Bob
Flitwick had just read him. Bob
 Bob
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Bob
Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle Bob
embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting Bob
redder and redder in the face as he called for more Bob
wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the Bob
cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and Bob
blushed, her top hat lopsided. Bob
 Bob
When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down Bob
with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a Bob
pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- Bob
Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess Bob
set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a Bob
nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Bob
Norris’s Christmas dinner. Bob
 Bob
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon Bob
having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, Bob
cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the Bob
fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry Bob
broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Bob
Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if Bob
Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much. Bob
 Bob
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, Bob
and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy Bob
to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy Bob
chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower Bob
because they’d stolen his prefect badge. Bob
 Bob
It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet Bob
something had been nagging at the back of his mind Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to Bob
think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had Bob
sent it. Bob
 Bob
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing Bob
mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon Bob
as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry Bob
leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the Bob
cloak out from under it. Bob
 Bob
His father’s ... this had been his father’s. He let the Bob
material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light Bob
as air. Use it well, the note had said. Bob
 Bob
He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and Bob
wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at Bob
his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a Bob
very funny feeling. Bob
 Bob
Use it well. Bob
 Bob
Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Bob
Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement Bob
flooded through him as he stood there in the dark Bob
and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, Bob
and Filch would never know. Bob
 Bob
Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Bob
Something held him back — his father’s cloak — he Bob
felt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use Bob
it alone. Bob
 Bob
He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across Bob
the common room, and climbed through the portrait Bob
hole. Bob
 Bob
“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said Bob
nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, Bob
and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Bob
Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long as Bob
he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel Bob
was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight Bob
around him as he walked. Bob
 Bob
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a Bob
lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The Bob
lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and Bob
even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, Bob
the sight gave him the creeps. Bob
 Bob
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the Bob
library. Stepping carefully over the rope that Bob
separated these books from the rest of the library, he Bob
held up his lamp to read the titles. Bob
 Bob
They didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold Bob
letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t Bob
understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a Bob
dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The Bob
hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he Bob
was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint Bob
whispering was coming from the books, as though Bob
they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be. Bob
 Bob
He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down Bob
carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom Bob
shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black Bob
and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out Bob
with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, Bob
balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. Bob
 Bob
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — Bob
the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but Bob
the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, Bob
earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked Bob
over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he Bob
Page | 230 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — Bob
stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran Bob
for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, Bob
wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry Bob
slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked Bob
off up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in Bob
his ears. Bob
 Bob
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of Bob
armor. He had been so busy getting away from the Bob
library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was Bob
going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t Bob
recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of Bob
armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be Bob
five floors above there. Bob
 Bob
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if Bob
anyone was wandering around at night, and Bob
somebody’s been in the library — Restricted Section.” Bob
 Bob
Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he Bob
was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, Bob
greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it Bob
was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, Bob
they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.” Bob
 Bob
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape Bob
came around the corner ahead. They couldn’t see Bob
him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if Bob
they came much nearer they’d knock right into him — Bob
the cloak didn’t stop him from being solid. Bob
 Bob
He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood Bob
ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed Bob
through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, Bob
and to his relief he managed to get inside the room Bob
without their noticing anything. They walked straight Bob
past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing Bob
deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
had been close, very close. It was a few seconds Bob
before he noticed anything about the room he had Bob
hidden in. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes Bob
of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and Bob
there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but Bob
propped against the wall facing him was something Bob
that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that Bob
looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it Bob
out of the way. Bob
 Bob
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, Bob
with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed Bob
feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Bob
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. Bob
 Bob
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch Bob
and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, Bob
wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. Bob
He stepped in front of it. Bob
 Bob
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself Bob
from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was Bob
pounding far more furiously than when the book had Bob
screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the Bob
mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right Bob
behind him. Bob
 Bob
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he Bob
turned slowly back to the mirror. Bob
 Bob
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared- Bob
looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least Bob
ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, Bob
no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was Bob
he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this Bob
mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or Bob
not? Bob
 Bob
Page | 232 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing Bob
right behind his reflection was smiling at him and Bob
waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind Bob
him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their Bob
reflections were so close together, but he felt only air Bob
— she and the others existed only in the mirror. Bob
 Bob
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair Bob
and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry Bob
thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright Bob
green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed Bob
that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same Bob
time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next Bob
to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and Bob
his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just Bob
as Harry’s did. Bob
 Bob
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose Bob
was nearly touching that of his reflection. Bob
 Bob
“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?” Bob
 Bob
They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry Bob
looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, Bob
and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses Bob
like his, even a little old man who looked as though Bob
he had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was looking at Bob
his family, for the first time in his life. Bob
 Bob
The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared Bob
hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against Bob
the glass as though he was hoping to fall right Bob
through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of Bob
ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. Bob
 Bob
How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The Bob
reflections did not fade and he looked and looked Bob
until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. Bob
He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to Bob
 Bob

bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, Bob
whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the Bob
room. Bob
 Bob
“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly. Bob
 Bob
“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show Bob
you the mirror.” Bob
 Bob
“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly. Bob
 Bob
“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, Bob
you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and Bob
everyone.” Bob
 Bob
“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just Bob
come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe Bob
it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Bob
Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why Bob
aren’t you eating anything?” Bob
 Bob
Harry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and Bob
would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost Bob
forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very important Bob
anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was Bob
guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? Bob
 Bob
“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.” Bob
 Bob
What Harry feared most was that he might not be Bob
able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered Bob
in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly Bob
the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from Bob
the library, wandering around the dark passageways Bob
for nearly an hour. Bob
 Bob
“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.” Bob
 Bob
“IVo!” Harry hissed. “I know it’s here somewhere.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the Bob
opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron Bob
started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Bob
Harry spotted the suit of armor. Bob
 Bob
“It’s here — just here — yes!” Bob
 Bob
They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak Bob
from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. Bob
 Bob
There they were. His mother and father beamed at the Bob
sight of him. Bob
 Bob
“See?” Harry whispered. Bob
 Bob
“I can’t see anything.” Bob
 Bob
“Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...” Bob
“I can only see you.” Bob
 Bob
“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” Bob
 Bob
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the Bob
mirror, he couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron Bob
in his paisley pajamas. Bob
 Bob
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. Bob
“Look at me!” he said. Bob
 Bob
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” Bob
 Bob
“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — Bob
and I’m Head Boy!” Bob
 Bob
“What?” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and Bob
I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — Bob
I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Bob
 Bob
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to Bob
look excitedly at Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Do you think this mirror shows the future?” Bob
 Bob
“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have Bob
another look — ” Bob
 Bob
“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit Bob
more time.” Bob
 Bob
“You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s Bob
interesting about that? I want to see my parents.” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t push me — ” Bob
 Bob
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to Bob
their discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they Bob
had been talking. Bob
 Bob
“Quick!” Bob
 Bob
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous Bob
eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Bob
Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing Bob
— did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an Bob
age, she turned and left. Bob
 Bob
“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet Bob
she heard us. Come on.” Bob
 Bob
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. Bob
 Bob
The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“No.” Bob
 Bob
“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?” Bob
 Bob
“No ... you go ...” Bob
 Bob
“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that Bob
mirror. Don’t go back tonight.” Bob
 Bob
“Why not?” Bob
 Bob
“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and Bob
anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. Bob
Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. Bob
So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into Bob
you? What if you knock something over?” Bob
 Bob
“You sound like Hermione.” Bob
 Bob
“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” Bob
 Bob
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which Bob
was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t Bob
going to stop him. Bob
 Bob
That third night he found his way more quickly than Bob
before. He was walking so fast he knew he was Bob
making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet Bob
anyone. Bob
 Bob
And there were his mother and father smiling at him Bob
again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Bob
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the Bob
mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying Bob
here all night with his family. Nothing at all. Bob
 Bob
Except — Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“So — back again, Harry?” Bob
 Bob
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He Bob
looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the Bob
wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry Bob
must have walked straight past him, so desperate to Bob
get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him. Bob
 Bob
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” Bob
 Bob
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make Bob
you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see Bob
that he was smiling. Bob
 Bob
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on Bob
the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, Bob
have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” Bob
 Bob
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” Bob
 Bob
“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” Bob
 Bob
“It — well — it shows me my family — ” Bob
 Bob
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” Bob
 Bob
“How did you know — ?” Bob
 Bob
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Bob
Dumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what the Bob
Mirror of Erised shows us all?” Bob
 Bob
Harry shook his head. Bob
 Bob
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be Bob
able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, Bob
that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly Bob
as he is. Does that help?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us Bob
what we want ... whatever we want ...” Bob
 Bob
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us Bob
nothing more or less than the deepest, most Bob
desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never Bob
known your family, see them standing around you. Bob
Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed Bob
by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best Bob
of all of them. However, this mirror will give us Bob
neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away Bob
before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been Bob
driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or Bob
even possible. Bob
 Bob
“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Bob
Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If Bob
you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It Bob
does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, Bob
remember that. Now, why don’t you put that Bob
admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” Bob
 Bob
Harry stood up. Bob
 Bob
“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you Bob
something?” Bob
 Bob
“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. Bob
“You may ask me one more thing, however.” Bob
 Bob
“What do you see when you look in the mirror?” Bob
 Bob
“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” Bob
 Bob
Harry stared. Bob
 Bob
“One can never have enough socks,” said Bob
Dumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on Bob
giving me books.” Bob
 Bob
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Bob
Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite Bob
truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Bob
Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal Bob
question. Bob

NICHOLAS FLAMBL Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking Bob
for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Bob
Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed Bob
folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he Bob
could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, Bob
but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over Bob
and over again he dreamed about his parents Bob
disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high Bob
voice cackled with laughter. Bob
 Bob
“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could Bob
drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about Bob
these dreams. Bob
 Bob
Hermione, who came back the day before term Bob
started, took a different view of things. She was torn Bob
between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, Bob
roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had Bob
caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at Bob
least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel Bob
in a library book, even though Harry was still sure Bob
he’d read the name somewhere. Once term had Bob
started, they were back to skimming through books Bob
for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even Bob
less time than the other two, because Quidditch Bob
practice had started again. Bob
 Bob
Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even Bob
the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t Bob
dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Bob
Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Bob
Wood’s side. If they won their next match, against Bob
Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the Bob
House Championship for the first time in seven years. Bob
Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he Bob
had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after Bob
training. Bob
 Bob
Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice Bob
session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d Bob
just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept Bob
dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off Bob
their brooms. Bob
 Bob
“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s Bob
exactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! Bob
Snape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking for Bob
any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!” Bob
 Bob
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these Bob
words. Bob
 Bob
“ Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a Bob
mouthful of mud. “When’s he ever refereed a Bob
Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might Bob
overtake Slytherin.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
The rest of the team landed next to George to Bob
complain, too. Bob
 Bob
“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make Bob
sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an Bob
excuse to pick on us.” Bob
 Bob
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had Bob
another reason for not wanting Snape near him while Bob
he was playing Quidditch. ... Bob
 Bob
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another Bob
as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed Bob
straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where Bob
he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was Bob
the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry Bob
and Ron thought was very good for her. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry Bob
sat down next to him, “I need to concern” He caught Bob
sight of Harry’s face. “What’s the matter with you? Bob
 Bob
You look terrible.” Bob
 Bob
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Bob
 Bob
Harry told the other two about Snape ’s sudden, Bob
sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once. Bob
 Bob
“Say you’re ill,” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested. Bob
 Bob
“ Really break your leg,” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I Bob
back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
At that moment Neville toppled into the common Bob
room. How he had managed to climb through the Bob
portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs Bob
had been stuck together with what they recognized at Bob
once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to Bob
bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. Bob
 Bob
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who Bob
leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville’s Bob
legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. Bob
 Bob
“What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him Bob
over to sit with Harry and Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the Bob
library. He said he’d been looking for someone to Bob
practice that on.” Bob
 Bob
“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Bob
Neville. “Report him!” Bob
 Bob
Neville shook his head. Bob
 Bob
“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled. Bob
 Bob
“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. Bob
“He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no Bob
reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.” Bob
 Bob
“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be Bob
in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville Bob
choked out. Bob
 Bob
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Bob
Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Bob
Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Bob
Neville, who looked as though he might cry. Bob
 Bob

“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Bob
Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And Bob
where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.” Bob
 Bob
Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he Bob
unwrapped the frog. Bob
 Bob
“Thanks, Harry ... I think I’ll go to bed. ... D’you want Bob
the card, you collect them, don’t you?” Bob
 Bob
As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Bob
Wizard card. Bob
 Bob
“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I Bob
ever — ” Bob
 Bob
He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he Bob
looked up at Ron and Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“I’ve found him\” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I Bob
told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it Bob
on the train coming here — listen to this: Bob
 Bob
‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of Bob
the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the Bob
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his Bob
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’V’ Bob
 Bob
Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so Bob
excited since they’d gotten back the marks for their Bob
very first piece of homework. Bob
 Bob
“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs Bob
to the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had Bob
time to exchange mystified looks before she was Bob
dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. Bob
 Bob
“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered Bob
excitedly. “I got this out of the library weeks ago for a Bob
bit of light reading.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet Bob
until she’d looked something up, and started flicking Bob
frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. Bob
 Bob
At last she found what she was looking for. Bob
 Bob
“I knew it! I knew it!” Bob
 Bob
“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Bob
Hermione ignored him. Bob
 Bob
“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the Bob
only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone\” Bob
 Bob
This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected. Bob
 Bob
“The what?” said Harry and Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, honestly , don’t you two read? Look — read that, Bob
there.” Bob
 Bob
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Bob
Ron read: Bob
 Bob
The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with Bob
making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance Bob
with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform Bob
any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Bob
Life, which will make the drinker immortal. Bob
 Bob
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone Bob
over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in Bob
existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted Bob
alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated Bob
his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, Bob
enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle Bob
(six hundred and fifty-eight). Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had Bob
finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s Bob
Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep Bob
it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew Bob
someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone Bob
moved out of Gringotts!” Bob
 Bob
“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever Bob
dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Bob
 Bob
Anyone would want it.” Bob
 Bob
“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study Bob
of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s Bob
not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is Bob
he?” Bob
 Bob
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Bob
while copying down different ways of treating werewolf Bob
bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d Bob
do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t Bob
until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Bob
Harry remembered about Snape and the coming Bob
match. Bob
 Bob
“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I Bob
don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared Bob
to face Snape. I’ll show them ... it’ll really wipe the Bob
smiles off their faces if we win.” Bob
 Bob
“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” Bob
said Hermione. Bob
 Bob
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became Bob
more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Bob
Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, Bob
either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Bob
Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for Bob
seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such Bob
a biased referee? Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, Bob
but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever Bob
he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape Bob
was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Bob
Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly Bob
torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape Bob
possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Bob
Stone? Harry didn’t see how he could — yet he Bob
sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could Bob
read minds. Bob
 Bob
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck Bob
outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron Bob
and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever Bob
see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call Bob
comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep Bob
talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked Bob
up his Nimbus Two Thousand. Bob
 Bob
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in Bob
the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand Bob
why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had Bob
both brought their wands to the match. Little did Bob
Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly Bob
practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the Bob
idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready Bob
to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to Bob
hurt Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione Bob
muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. Bob
 Bob
“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.” Bob
 Bob
Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry Bob
aside. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever Bob
need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish Bob
 Bob

the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too Bob
much.” Bob
 Bob
“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, Bob
peering out of the door. “Even — blimey — Bob
Dumbledore’s come to watch!” Bob
 Bob
Harry’s heart did a somersault. Bob
 Bob
“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make Bob
sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that Bob
silver beard. Bob
 Bob
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was Bob
safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare Bob
to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. Bob
 Bob
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as Bob
the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron Bob
noticed, too. Bob
 Bob
“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Bob
Hermione. “Look — they’re off. Ouch!” Bob
 Bob
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It Bob
was Malfoy. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” Bob
 Bob
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. Bob
 Bob
“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom Bob
this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Bob
Weasley?” Bob
 Bob
Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Bob
Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit Bob
a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers Bob
crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, Bob
 Bob

 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Bob
Snitch. Bob
 Bob
“You know how I think they choose people for the Bob
Gryffindor team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes Bob
later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty Bob
for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. Bob
 Bob
See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s Bob
the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be Bob
on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” Bob
 Bob
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Bob
Malfoy. Bob
 Bob
“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered. Bob
 Bob
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Bob
Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, Bob
said, “You tell him, Neville.” Bob
 Bob
“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Bob
Weasley, and that’s saying something.” Bob
 Bob
Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking Bob
point with anxiety about Harry. Bob
 Bob
“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” Bob
 Bob
“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” Bob
 Bob
“What? Where?” Bob
 Bob
Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, Bob
which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Bob
Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, Bob
as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. Bob
 Bob
“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted Bob
some money on the ground!” said Malfoy. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was Bob
happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to Bob
the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the Bob
back of his seat to help. Bob
 Bob
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto Bob
her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — Bob
she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around Bob
under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from Bob
the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. Bob
 Bob
Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in Bob
time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing Bob
him by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled Bob
out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch Bob
clasped in his hand. Bob
 Bob
The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one Bob
could ever remember the Snitch being caught so Bob
quickly. Bob
 Bob
“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s Bob
won! We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Bob
Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and Bob
hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. Bob
 Bob
Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. Bob
He couldn’t believe it. He’d done it — the game was Bob
over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors Bob
came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land Bob
nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt Bob
a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Bob
Dumbledore’s smiling face. Bob
 Bob
“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Bob
Harry could hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been Bob
brooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . Bob
excellent ...” Bob

Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to Bob
take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the Bob
broomshed. He couldn’t ever remember feeling Bob
happier. He’d really done something to be proud of Bob
now — no one could say he was just a famous name Bob
any more. The evening air had never smelled so Bob
sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the Bob
last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Bob
Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Bob
Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and Bob
down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. Bob
 Bob
Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the Bob
wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its Bob
windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in Bob
the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Snape. ... Bob
 Bob
And speaking of Snape . . . Bob
 Bob
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of Bob
the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked Bob
as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Bob
Harry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched. Bob
He recognized the figure’s prowling walk. Snape, Bob
sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at Bob
dinner — what was going on? Bob
 Bob
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand Bob
and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Bob
Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. Bob
 Bob
The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape Bob
had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, Bob
brushing the top branches of trees until he heard Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly Bob
in a towering beech tree. Bob
 Bob
He climbed carefully along one of the branches, Bob
holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through Bob
the leaves. Bob
 Bob
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he Bob
wasn’t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t Bob
make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering Bob
worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they Bob
were saying. Bob
 Bob
"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of Bob
all p-places, Severus ...” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his Bob
voice icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about Bob
the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.” Bob
 Bob
Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling Bob
something. Snape interrupted him. Bob
 Bob
“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Bob
Hagrid’s yet?” Bob
 Bob
“B-b-but Severus, I — ” Bob
 Bob
“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Bob
Snape, taking a step toward him. Bob
 Bob
“I-I don’t know what you — ” Bob
 Bob
“You know perfectly well what I mean.” Bob
 Bob
An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the Bob
tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, Bob
 Bob
“ — your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.” Bob

“Very well,” Snape cut in. “Well have another little Bob

and decided where your loyalties lie.” Bob
 Bob
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the Bob
clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Bob
Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was Bob
petrified. Bob

“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked. Bob
 Bob
“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Bob
Harry on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, Bob
and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- Bob
handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says Bob
he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! Bob
Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re Bob
having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and Bob
stuff from the kitchens.” Bob
 Bob
“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s Bob
find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. ...” Bob
 Bob
He made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting Bob
the door behind them, then he told them what he’d Bob
seen and heard. Bob
 Bob
“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Bob
Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He Bob
asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said Bob
something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — I reckon Bob
there are other things guarding the stone apart from Bob
Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell Bob

would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Bob

 Bob
“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell Bob
stands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm. Bob

“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron. Bob

Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d Bob
thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be Bob
getting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as though Bob
he’d cracked yet. Bob
 Bob
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Bob
Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door Bob
to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape Bob
was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which Bob
surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Bob
Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an Bob
encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling Bob
people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter. Bob
 Bob
Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Bob
Sorcerer’s Stone. She had started drawing up study Bob
schedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and Bob
Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging Bob
them to do the same. Bob
 Bob

“Hermione, the exams are ages away.” Bob
 Bob
“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, Bob
that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” Bob
 Bob
“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded Bob
her. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already Bob
know it all.” Bob
 Bob
“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize Bob
we need to pass these exams to get into the second Bob
year? They’re very important, I should have started Bob
studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into Bob
me.” Bob
 Bob
Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking Bob
along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so Bob
much homework on them that the Easter holidays Bob
weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It Bob
was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting Bob
the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand Bob
movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron Bob
spent most of their free time in the library with her, Bob
trying to get through all their extra work. Bob
 Bob
“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one Bob
afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking Bob
longingly out of the library window. It was the first Bob
really fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a Bob
clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in Bob
the air of summer coming. Bob
 Bob
Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Bob
Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he Bob
heard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doing in the Bob
library?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind Bob
his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin Bob
overcoat. Bob
 Bob
“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their Bob
interest at once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He Bob
looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin’ fer Bob
Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron Bob
impressively. “And we know what that dog’s guarding, Bob
it’s a Sorcerer’s St — ” Bob
 Bob
“Shhhh\” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if Bob
anyone was listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it, Bob
what’s the matter with yeh?” Bob
 Bob
“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a Bob
matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding Bob
the Stone apart from Fluffy — ” Bob
 Bob
“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see Bob
me later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, Bob
but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ Bob
s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ” Bob
 Bob
“See you later, then,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid shuffled off. Bob
 Bob
“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Bob
Hermione thoughtfully. Bob
 Bob
“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?” Bob
 Bob
“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, Bob
who’d had enough of working. He came back a Bob
minute later with a pile of books in his arms and Bob
slammed them down on the table. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Dragons'.” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff Bob
about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Bob
Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Bob
Keeper’s Guide.” Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid ’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the Bob
first time I ever met him,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon Bob
breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention Bob
of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop Bob
Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in Bob
the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, Bob
it’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got Bob
off wild ones in Romania.” Bob
 Bob
“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh Bob
Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic Bob
has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind Bob
have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted Bob
them, to make them forget.” Bob
 Bob
“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione. Bob
 Bob
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s Bob
hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all Bob
the curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?” Bob
before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly Bob
behind them. Bob
 Bob
It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a Bob
warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat Bob
sandwiches, which they refused. Bob
 Bob
“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around Bob
the bush. “We were wondering if you could tell us Bob
what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Bob
Fluffy.” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid frowned at him. Bob
 Bob
“O’ course I can’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know Bob
meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I Bob
wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good Bob
reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I Bob
s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how Bob
yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, Bob
but you do know, you know everything that goes on Bob
round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering Bob
voice. Hagrid ’s beard twitched and they could tell he Bob
was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the Bob
guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered Bob
who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, Bob
apart from you.” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Bob
Ron beamed at Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... Bob
let’s see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some Bob
o’ the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout Bob
— Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” he Bob
ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — Bob
an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. Bob
 Bob
Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Bob
Snape.” Bob
 Bob
“Snape?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Page | 260 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Bob
Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter Bob
steal it.” Bob
 Bob
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the Bob
same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting Bob
the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the Bob
other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew Bob
everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and Bob
how to get past Fluffy. Bob
 Bob
“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Bob
Fluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. Bob
 Bob
“And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even Bob
one of the teachers?” Bob
 Bob
“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said Bob
Hagrid proudly. Bob
 Bob
“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the Bob
others. “Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m Bob
boiling.” Bob
 Bob
“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him Bob
glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid — what’s that?” Bob
 Bob
But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of Bob
the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. Bob
 Bob
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, Bob
“That’s — er ...” Bob
 Bob
“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching Bob
over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. “It must’ve Bob
cost you a fortune.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Page | 261 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the Bob
village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards Bob
with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of Bob
it, ter be honest.” Bob
 Bob
“But what are you going to do with it when it’s Bob
hatched?” said Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling Bob
a large book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the Bob
library — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — Bob
it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep Bob
the egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on Bob
’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ Bob
brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ Bob
see here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I Bob
got there’s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They’re rare, Bob
them.” Bob
 Bob
He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione Bob
didn’t. Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said. Bob
 Bob
But Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily Bob
as he stoked the fire. Bob
 Bob
So now they had something else to worry about: what Bob
might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was Bob
hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. Bob
 Bob
“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron Bob
sighed, as evening after evening they struggled Bob
through all the extra homework they were getting. Bob
Hermione had now started making study schedules Bob
for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry Bob
another note from Hagrid. He had written only two Bob
words: It’s hatching. Bob
 Bob
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to Bob
the hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it. Bob
 Bob
“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going Bob
to see a dragon hatching?” Bob
 Bob
“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s Bob
nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone Bob
finds out what he’s doing — ” Bob
 Bob
“Shut up!” Harry whispered. Bob
 Bob
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped Bob
dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t Bob
like the look on Malfoy’s face at all. Bob
 Bob
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology Bob
and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Bob
Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break. Bob
When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of Bob
their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels Bob
at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge Bob
of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed Bob
and excited. Bob
 Bob
“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside. Bob
 Bob
The egg was lying on the table. There were deep Bob
cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny Bob
clicking noise was coming from it. Bob
 Bob
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched Bob
with bated breath. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg Bob
split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It Bob
wasn’t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a Bob
crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge Bob
compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout Bob
with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, Bob
orange eyes. Bob
 Bob
It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. Bob
 Bob
“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached Bob
out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head. It snapped at Bob
his fingers, showing pointed fangs. Bob
 Bob
“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Bob
Ridgebacks grow, exactly?” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly Bob
drained from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to Bob
the window. Bob
 Bob
“What’s the matter?” Bob
 Bob
“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains Bob
— it’s a kid — he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.” Bob
 Bob
Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a Bob
distance there was no mistaking him. Bob
 Bob
Malfoy had seen the dragon. Bob
 Bob
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face Bob
during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione Bob
very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Bob
Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. Bob
 Bob
“Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.” Bob
 Bob
Page | 264 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times Bob
in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its Bob
nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t been doing his gamekeeping Bob
duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. Bob
There were empty brandy bottles and chicken Bob
feathers all over the floor. Bob
 Bob
“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking Bob
at the dragon with misty eyes. “He really knows me Bob
now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s Mommy?” Bob
 Bob
“He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear. Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and Bob
Norbert’s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy Bob
could go to Dumbledore at any moment.” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid bit his lip. Bob
 Bob
“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ Bob
dump him, can’t.” Bob
 Bob
Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Charlie,” he said. Bob
 Bob
“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?” Bob
 Bob
“No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Bob
Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Bob
Charlie can take care of him and then put him back Bob
in the wild!” Bob
 Bob
“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?” Bob
 Bob
And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send Bob
an owl to Charlie to ask him. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
The following week dragged by. Wednesday night Bob
found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the Bob
common room, long after everyone else had gone to Bob
bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight Bob
when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out Bob
of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak. Bob
He had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed Bob
Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. Bob
 Bob
“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which Bob
was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going Bob
to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that Bob
dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but Bob
the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a Bob
fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off Bob
for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a Bob
lullaby.” Bob
 Bob
There was a tap on the dark window. Bob
 Bob
“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll Bob
have Charlie’s answer!” Bob
 Bob
The three of them put their heads together to read the Bob
note. Bob
 Bob
Dear Ron, Bob
 Bob
How are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to Bob
take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy Bob
getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send Bob
him over with some friends of mine who are coming to Bob
visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen Bob
carrying an illegal dragon. Bob
 Bob
Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at Bob
midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and Bob
take him away while it’s still dark. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob

Charlie Bob
 Bob
They looked at one another. Bob
 Bob
“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It Bob
shouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big Bob
enough to cover two of us and Norbert.” Bob
 Bob
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that Bob
the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Bob
Norbert — and Malfoy. Bob
 Bob
There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten Bob
hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn’t Bob
know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey — Bob
would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, Bob
though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty Bob
shade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were Bob
poisonous. Bob
 Bob
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing Bob
at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in Bob
bed. Bob
 Bob
“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that Bob
feels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Bob
Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he Bob
could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept Bob
threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told Bob
her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I Bob
shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s Bob
why he’s doing this.” Bob
 Bob
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Bob
Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the Bob
contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. Bob
 Bob
“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. Bob
 Bob
“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s Bob
letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to Bob
know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” Bob
 Bob
Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. Bob
Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made Bob
them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. Bob
 Bob
“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Bob
Hermione. “We haven’t got time to send Charlie Bob
another owl, and this could be our only chance to get Bob
rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got Bob
the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about Bob
that.” Bob
 Bob
They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a Bob
bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who Bob
opened a window to talk to them. Bob
 Bob
“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky Bob
stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.” Bob
 Bob
When they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes Bob
filled with tears, although that might have been Bob
because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. Bob
 Bob
“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ Bob
playin’ — he’s only a baby, after all.” Bob
 Bob
The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the Bob
windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to Bob
the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly Bob
enough. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time Bob
came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn’t Bob
been so worried about what they had to do. It was a Bob
very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late Bob
arriving at Hagrid ’s hut because they’d had to wait for Bob
Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, Bob
where he’d been playing tennis against the wall. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. Bob
 Bob
“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” Bob
said Hagrid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his Bob
teddy bear in case he gets lonely.” Bob
 Bob
From inside the crate came ripping noises that Bob
sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his Bob
head torn off. Bob
 Bob
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Bob
Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak Bob
and stepped underneath it themselves. “Mommy will Bob
never forget you!” Bob
 Bob
How they managed to get the crate back up to the Bob
castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as Bob
they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the Bob
entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up Bob
another staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s Bob
shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier. Bob
 Bob
“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the Bob
corridor beneath the tallest tower. Bob
 Bob
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them Bob
almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were Bob
already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, Bob
staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling Bob
with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair Bob
net, had Malfoy by the ear. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Bob
Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the Bob
night, how dare you — ” Bob
 Bob
“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s Bob
coming — he’s got a dragon!” Bob
 Bob
“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Bob
Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Bob
Malfoy!” Bob
 Bob
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower Bob
seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not Bob
until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did Bob
they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe Bob
properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. Bob
 Bob
“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t,” Harry advised her. Bob
 Bob
Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert Bob
thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, Bob
four broomsticks came swooping down out of the Bob
darkness. Bob
 Bob
Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Bob
Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so Bob
they could suspend Norbert between them. They all Bob
helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry Bob
and Hermione shook hands with the others and Bob
thanked them very much. Bob
 Bob
At last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their Bob
hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was Bob
off them. No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — Bob
what could spoil their happiness? Bob
 Bob
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the Bob
stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face Bob
loomed suddenly out of the darkness. Bob
 Bob
“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.” Bob
 Bob
They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. Bob

THE FORBIDDEN FOREST Bob
 Bob
Things couldn’t have been worse. Bob
 Bob
Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s Bob
study on the first floor, where they sat and waited Bob
without saying a word to each other. Hermione was Bob
trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories Bob
chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more Bob
feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were Bob
going to get out of trouble this time. They were Bob
cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to Bob
forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Bob
Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out Bob
of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of Bob
night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, Bob
which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Bob
Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as Bob
well be packing their bags already. Bob
 Bob
Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been Bob
worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall Bob
appeared, she was leading Neville. Bob

“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the Bob
other two. “I was trying to find you to warn you, I Bob
heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he Bob
said you had a drag — ” Bob
 Bob
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Bob
Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more Bob
likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over Bob
the three of them. Bob
 Bob
“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch Bob
says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one Bob
o’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.” Bob
 Bob
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to Bob
answer a teacher’s question. She was staring at her Bob
slippers, as still as a statue. Bob
 Bob
“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” Bob
said Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius Bob
to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and- Bob
bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed Bob
and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose Bob
you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the Bob
story and believed it, too?” Bob
 Bob
Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him Bob
without words that this wasn’t true, because Neville Bob
was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Bob
Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to Bob
try and find them in the dark, to warn them. Bob
 Bob
“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four Bob
students out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of Bob
such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you Bob
had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Bob
Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of Bob
you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Bob
Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk Bob

around school at night, especially these days, it’s very Bob
dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Bob
Gryffindor.” Bob
 Bob
“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the Bob
lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match. Bob
 Bob
“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, Bob
breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. Bob
 Bob
“Professor — please — ” Bob
 Bob
“You can’t—” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get Bob
back to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed Bob
of Gryffindor students.” Bob
 Bob
A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in Bob
last place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance Bob
Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as Bob
though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. Bob
How could they ever make up for this? Bob
 Bob
Harry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville Bob
sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Bob
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort Bob
him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the Bob
dawn. What would happen when the rest of Bob
Gryffindor found out what they’d done? Bob
 Bob
At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses Bob
that recorded the House points the next day thought Bob
there ’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly Bob
have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? Bob
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, Bob
the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch Bob
matches, had lost them all those points, him and a Bob
couple of other stupid first years. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
From being one of the most popular and admired Bob
people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most Bob
hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on Bob
him, because everyone had been longing to see Bob
Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry Bob
went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their Bob
voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other Bob
hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and Bob
cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!” Bob
 Bob
Only Ron stood by him. Bob
 Bob
“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George Bob
have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been Bob
here, and people still like them.” Bob
 Bob
“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one Bob
go, though, have they?” said Harry miserably. Bob
 Bob
“Well — no,” Ron admitted. Bob
 Bob
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry Bob
swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t Bob
his business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking Bob
around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that Bob
he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Bob
Quidditch team. Bob
 Bob
“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? Bob
 Bob
How are we going to get any points back if we can’t Bob
win at Quidditch?” Bob
 Bob
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the Bob
team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if Bob
they had to speak about him, they called him “the Bob
Seeker.” Bob
 Bob
Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t Bob
have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as Bob
 Bob

 Bob
well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Bob
Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in Bob
class, keeping her head down and working in silence. Bob
 Bob
Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far Bob
away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off Bob
his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to Bob
themselves, working late into the night, trying to Bob
remember the ingredients in complicated potions, Bob
learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates Bob
of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ... Bob
 Bob
Then, about a week before the exams were due to Bob
start, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in Bob
anything that didn’t concern him was put to an Bob
unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his Bob
own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering Bob
from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he Bob
heard Quirrell’s voice. Bob
 Bob
“No — no — not again, please — ” Bob
 Bob
It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Bob
Harry moved closer. Bob
 Bob
“All right — all right — ” he heard Quirrell sob. Bob
 Bob
Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the Bob
classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and Bob
looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out Bob
of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed Bob
him. He waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had Bob
disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was Bob
empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry Bob
was halfway toward it before he remembered what Bob
he’d promised himself about not meddling. Bob
 Bob
All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Bob
Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking Bob
with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to Bob
have given in at last. Bob
 Bob
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was Bob
testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d Bob
heard. Bob
 Bob
“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told Bob
him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell — ” Bob
 Bob
“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him Bob
without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the Bob
thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a Bob
book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a Bob
giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?” Bob
 Bob
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s Bob
eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. Bob
 Bob
“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done Bob
ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown Bob
out for sure.” Bob
 Bob
“But we’ve got no proof.” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too Bob
scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he Bob
doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and Bob
that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do Bob
you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a Bob
secret we hate him, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it Bob
up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life Bob
depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the Bob
more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. Bob
And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about Bob
the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.” Bob
 Bob
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t. Bob

 Bob
 Bob
“If we just do a bit of poking around — ” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking Bob
around.” Bob
 Bob
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to Bob
learn the names of its moons. Bob
 Bob
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Bob
Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They Bob
were all the same: Bob
 Bob
Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock Bob
tonight. Bob
 Bob
Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. Bob
 Bob
Professor M. McGonagall Bob
 Bob
Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in Bob
the furor over the points they’d lost. He half expected Bob
Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of Bob
studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry, Bob
she felt they deserved what they’d got. Bob
 Bob
At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron Bob
in the common room and went down to the entrance Bob
hall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so Bob
was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had Bob
gotten a detention, too. Bob
 Bob
“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading Bob
them outside. Bob
 Bob
“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule Bob
again, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh Bob
yes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you Bob
ask me. ... It’s just a pity they let the old Bob
punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from Bob

 Bob
the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in Bob
my office, keep ’em well oiled in case they’re ever Bob
needed. ... Right, off we go, and don’t think of running Bob
off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.” Bob
 Bob
They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville Bob
kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment Bob
was going to be. It must be something really horrible, Bob
or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted. Bob
 Bob
The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it Bob
kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry Bob
could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then Bob
they heard a distant shout. Bob
 Bob
“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.” Bob
 Bob
Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working Bob
with Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must Bob
have showed in his face, because Filch said, “I Bob
suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with Bob
that oaf? Well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest Bob
you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come Bob
out in one piece.” Bob
 Bob
At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy Bob
stopped dead in his tracks. Bob
 Bob
“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite Bob
as cool as usual. “We can’t go in there at night — Bob
there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I Bob
heard.” Bob
 Bob
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a Bob
choking noise. Bob
 Bob
“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice Bob
cracking with glee. “Should’ve thought of them Bob
werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Bob
Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, Bob
and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. Bob
 Bob
“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour Bob
already. All right, Harry, Hermione?” Bob
 Bob
“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Bob
Filch coldly, “they’re here to be punished, after all.” Bob
 Bob
“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Bob
Filch. “Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do Bob
that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.” Bob
 Bob
“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of Bob
them,” he added nastily, and he turned and started Bob
back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the Bob
darkness. Bob
 Bob
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. Bob
 Bob
“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was Bob
pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. Bob
 Bob
“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Bob
Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got Bob
ter pay fer it.” Bob
 Bob
“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I Bob
thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my Bob
father knew I was doing this, he’d — ” Bob
 Bob
“ — tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid Bob
growled. “Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone? Bob
Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh think Bob
yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back Bob
off ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but Bob
then dropped his gaze. Bob
 Bob
“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, Bob
 Bob
’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ Bob
I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a Bob
moment.” Bob
 Bob
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his Bob
lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding Bob
earth track that disappeared into the thick black Bob
trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked Bob
into the forest. Bob
 Bob
“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on Bob
the ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. Bob
There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. Bob
This is the second time in a week. I found one dead Bob
last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor Bob
thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.” Bob
 Bob
“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us Bob
first?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his Bob
voice. Bob
 Bob
“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh Bob
if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the Bob
path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties Bob
an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood Bob
all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around Bob
since last night at least.” Bob
 Bob
“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s Bob
long teeth. Bob
 Bob
“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. Bob
“So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Bob
Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us Bob
finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s it — an’ Bob
if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll Bob
all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.” Bob
 Bob
The forest was black and silent. A little way into it Bob
they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Bob
Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Bob
Neville, and Fang took the right. Bob
 Bob
They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Bob
Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the Bob
branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the Bob
fallen leaves. Bob
 Bob
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. Bob
 Bob
“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry Bob
asked. Bob
 Bob
“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch Bob
a unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never Bob
knew one ter be hurt before.” Bob
 Bob
They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could Bob
hear running water; there must be a stream Bob
somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn Bob
blood here and there along the winding path. Bob
 Bob
“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ Bob
worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ Bob
then well be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them Bob
off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an Bob
arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready Bob
to fire. The three of them listened. Something was Bob
slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a Bob
cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound Bob
faded away. Bob
 Bob
“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here Bob
that shouldn’ be.” Bob
 Bob
“A werewolf?” Harry suggested. Bob
 Bob
“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, Bob
neither,” said Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but Bob
careful, now.” Bob
 Bob
They walked more slowly, ears straining for the Bob
faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, Bob
something definitely moved. Bob
 Bob
“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m Bob
armed!” Bob
 Bob
And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a Bob
horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, Bob
but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body Bob
with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws Bob
dropped. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are Bob
yeh?” Bob
 Bob
He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand. Bob
 Bob
“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a Bob
deep, sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?” Bob
 Bob
“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his Bob
crossbow. “There’s summat bad loose in this forest. Bob
This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the Bob
way. Students up at the school. An’ this is Ronan, Bob
you two. He’s a centaur.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And Bob
do you learn much, up at the school?” Bob
 Bob
“Erm — ” Bob
 Bob
“A bit,” said Hermione timidly. Bob
 Bob
“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He Bob
flung back his head and stared at the sky. “Mars is Bob
bright tonight.” Bob
 Bob
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad Bob
we’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn Bob
bin hurt — you seen anythin’?” Bob
 Bob
Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared Bob
unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. Bob
 Bob
“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. Bob
 Bob
“So it has been for ages past, so it is now.” Bob
 Bob
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, Bob
Ronan? Anythin’ unusual?” Bob
 Bob
“Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Bob
Hagrid watched him impatiently. “Unusually bright.” Bob
 Bob
“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit Bob
nearer home,” said Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed Bob
anythin’ strange?” Bob
 Bob
Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he Bob
said, “The forest hides many secrets.” Bob
 Bob
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid Bob
raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Bob
Ronan. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?” Bob
 Bob
“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?” Bob
 Bob
“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you Bob
seen anythin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn Bob
bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?” Bob
 Bob
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked Bob
skyward. Bob
 Bob
“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply. Bob
 Bob
“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of Bob
you do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be Bob
off, then.” Bob
 Bob
Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, Bob
staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until Bob
the trees blocked their view. Bob
 Bob
“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight Bob
answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not Bob
interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” Bob
 Bob
“Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves Bob
mostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if Bob
ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind, centaurs ... Bob
they know things ... jus’ don’ let on much.” Bob
 Bob
“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” Bob
said Harry. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Page | 285 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask Bob
me, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never Bob
heard anythin’ like it before.” Bob
 Bob
They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry Bob
kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the Bob
nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very Bob
glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. Bob
They had just passed a bend in the path when Bob
Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm. Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!” Bob
 Bob
“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the Bob
path, I’ll come back for yeh!” Bob
 Bob
They heard him crashing away through the Bob
undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very Bob
scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the Bob
rustling of leaves around them. Bob
 Bob
“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” Bob
whispered Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Bob
Neville ... it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.” Bob
 Bob
The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper Bob
than usual. Harry’s seemed to be picking up every Bob
sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going Bob
on? Where were the others? Bob
 Bob
At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s Bob
return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Bob
Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked Bob
up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville Bob
had panicked and sent up the sparks. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Well be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket Bob
you two were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Bob
Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go Bob
with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a Bob
whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time Bob
frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” Bob
 Bob
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Bob
Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an Bob
hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path Bob
became almost impossible to follow because the trees Bob
were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be Bob
getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a Bob
tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing Bob
around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing Bob
ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient Bob
oak. Bob
 Bob
“Look — ” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Bob
Malfoy. Bob
 Bob
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. Bob
They inched closer. Bob
 Bob
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry Bob
had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its Bob
long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where Bob
it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on Bob
the dark leaves. Bob
 Bob
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering Bob
sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on Bob
the edge of the clearing quivered. ... Then, out of the Bob
shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the Bob
ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Bob
Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the Bob
unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the Bob
animals side, and began to drink its blood. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“AAAAAAAAAAARGH ! ” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Bob
Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked Bob
right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its Bob
front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry Bob
— he couldn’t move for fear. Bob
 Bob
Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his Bob
head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half Bob
blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves Bob
behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean Bob
over Harry, charging at the figure. Bob
 Bob
The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his Bob
knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he Bob
looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was Bob
standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one Bob
looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a Bob
palomino body. Bob
 Bob
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to Bob
his feet. Bob
 Bob
“Yes — thank you — what was that?” Bob
 Bob
The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue Bob
eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Bob
Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, Bob
livid, on Harry’s forehead. Bob
 Bob
“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get Bob
back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — Bob
especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker Bob
this way. Bob
 Bob
“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered Bob
himself on to his front legs so that Harry could Bob
clamber onto his back. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from Bob
the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came Bob
bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and Bob
sweaty. Bob
 Bob
“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You Bob
have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are Bob
you a common mule?” Bob
 Bob
“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Bob
Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the Bob
better.” Bob
 Bob
“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. Bob
“Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set Bob
ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what Bob
is to come in the movements of the planets?” Bob
 Bob
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze Bob
thought he was acting for the best,” he said in his Bob
gloomy voice. Bob
 Bob
Bane kicked his back legs in anger. Bob
 Bob
“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs Bob
are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not Bob
our business to run around like donkeys after stray Bob
humans in our forest!” Bob
 Bob
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, Bob
so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. Bob
 Bob
“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bob
Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or Bob
have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set Bob
myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, Bob
yes, with humans alongside me if I must.” Bob

 Bob
And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on Bob
as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, Bob
leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. Bob
 Bob
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. Bob
 Bob
“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that Bob
thing you saved me from, anyway?” Bob
 Bob
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his Bob
head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did Bob
not answer Harry’s question. They made their way Bob
through the trees in silence for so long that Harry Bob
thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. Bob
They were passing through a particularly dense patch Bob
of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. Bob
 Bob
“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is Bob
used for?” Bob
 Bob
“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve Bob
only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.” Bob
 Bob
“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a Bob
unicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to Bob
lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a Bob
crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even Bob
if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. Bob
You have slain something pure and defenseless to Bob
save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a Bob
cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your Bob
lips.” Bob
 Bob
Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was Bob
dappled silver in the moonlight. Bob
 Bob
“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If Bob
you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t Bob
it?” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay Bob
alive long enough to drink something else — Bob
something that will bring you back to full strength Bob
and power — something that will mean you can never Bob
die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the Bob
school at this very moment?” Bob
 Bob
“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! Bob
But I don’t understand who — ” Bob
 Bob
“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years Bob
to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting Bob
their chance?” Bob
 Bob
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly Bob
around Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, Bob
he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told Bob
him on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Bob
Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough Bob
human left in him to die.” Bob
 Bob
“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was VoZ — ” Bob
 Bob
“Harry! Harry, are you all right?” Bob
 Bob
Hermione was running toward them down the path, Bob
Hagrid puffing along behind her. Bob
 Bob
“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was Bob
saying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that Bob
clearing back there.” Bob
 Bob
“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Bob
Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are Bob
safe now.” Bob
 Bob
Harry slid off his back. Bob

 Bob
“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets Bob
have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. Bob
I hope this is one of those times.” Bob
 Bob
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the Bob
forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. Bob
 Bob
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, Bob
waiting for them to return. He shouted something Bob
about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him Bob
awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide- Bob
eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what Bob
had happened in the forest. Bob
 Bob
Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in Bob
front of the fire. He was still shaking. Bob
 Bob
“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ... and Bob
Voldemort’s waiting in the forest ... and all this time Bob
we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. ...” Bob
 Bob
“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified Bob
whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. Bob
 Bob
Harry wasn’t listening. Bob
 Bob
“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. ... Bob
Bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering Bob
with what the planets say is going to happen. ... They Bob
must show that Voldemort’s coming back. ... Bane Bob
thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. ... I Bob
suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” Bob
 Bob
“Will you stop saying the name\” Ron hissed. Bob
 Bob
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Bob
Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will Bob
be able to come and finish me off. ... Well, I suppose Bob
Bane 11 be happy.” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word Bob
of comfort. Bob
 Bob
“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one Bob
You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore Bob
around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway, Bob
who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like Bob
fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says Bob
that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” Bob
 Bob
The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. Bob
They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But Bob
the night’s surprises weren’t over. Bob
 Bob
When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Bob
Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. Bob
There was a note pinned to it: Bob
 Bob
Just in case. Bob

THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR Bob
 Bob
In years to come, Harry would never quite remember Bob
how he had managed to get through his exams when Bob
he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through Bob
the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and Bob
there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and Bob
well behind the locked door. Bob
 Bob
It was sweltering hot, especially in the large Bob
classroom where they did their written papers. They Bob
had been given special, new quills for the exams, Bob
which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating Bob
spell. Bob
 Bob
They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick Bob
called them one by one into his class to see if they Bob
could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. Bob
Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse Bob
into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the Bob
snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Bob
Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their Bob
necks while they tried to remember how to make a Bob
Forgetfulness potion. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the Bob
stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been Bob
bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Bob
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves Bob
because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Bob
Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except Bob
that it was now worse than ever because there was a Bob
hooded figure dripping blood in it. Bob
 Bob
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry Bob
had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have Bob
scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Bob
Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Bob
Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, Bob
but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they Bob
were so busy with their studying they didn’t have Bob
much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else Bob
might be up to. Bob
 Bob
Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour Bob
of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d Bob
invented self-stirring cauldrons and they’d be free, Bob
free for a whole wonderful week until their exam Bob
results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns Bob
told them to put down their quills and roll up their Bob
parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the Bob
rest. Bob
 Bob
“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Bob
Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto Bob
the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the Bob
1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Bob
Elfric the Eager.” Bob
 Bob
Hermione always liked to go through their exam Bob
papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, Bob
so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under Bob
a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were Bob

 Bob
 Bob
tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was Bob
basking in the warm shallows. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching Bob
out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, Bob
 Bob
Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly Bob
we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” Bob
 Bob
Harry was rubbing his forehead. Bob
 Bob
“I wish I knew what this means\” he burst out angrily. Bob
“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but Bob
never as often as this.” Bob
 Bob
“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. Bob
 Bob
“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning ... it Bob
means danger’s coming. ...” Bob
 Bob
Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. Bob
 Bob
“Harry, relax, Hermione ’s right, the Stone’s safe as Bob
long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never Bob
had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. Bob
He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to Bob
try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch Bob
for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Bob
 Bob
Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking Bob
feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, Bob
something important. When he tried to explain this, Bob
Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last Bob
night and was halfway through my Transfiguration Bob
notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” Bob
 Bob
Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have Bob
anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl Bob
flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a Bob
note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Bob
Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to Bob
get past Fluffy . . . never . . . but — Bob
 Bob
Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. Bob
 Bob
“Where ’re you going?” said Ron sleepily. Bob
 Bob
“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had Bob
turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” Bob
 Bob
“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, Bob
scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid Bob
wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a Bob
stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in Bob
his pocket? How many people wander around with Bob
dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they Bob
found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it Bob
before?” Bob
 Bob
“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, Bob
sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t Bob
answer. Bob
 Bob
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; Bob
his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was Bob
shelling peas into a large bowl. Bob
 Bob
“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got Bob
time fer a drink?” Bob
 Bob
“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off. Bob
 Bob
“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you Bob
something. You know that night you won Norbert? Bob
What did the stranger you were playing cards with Bob
look like?” Bob
 Bob
Page | 297 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Dunno said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his Bob
cloak off.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his Bob
eyebrows. Bob
 Bob
“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in Bob
the Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the Bob
village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I Bob
never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” Bob
 Bob
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. Bob
 Bob
“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you Bob
mention Hogwarts at all?” Bob
 Bob
“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried Bob
to remember. “Yeah ... he asked what I did, an’ I told Bob
him I was gamekeeper here. ... He asked a bit about Bob
the sorta creatures I look after ... so I told him ... an’ I Bob
said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon ... Bob
an’ then ... I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept Bob
buyin’ me drinks. ... Let’s see ... yeah, then he said he Bob
had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I Bob
wanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he Bob
didn’ want it ter go ter any old home. ... So I told him, Bob
after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...” Bob
 Bob
“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Bob
 Bob
Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. Bob
 Bob
“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh Bob
meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a Bob
piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ Bob
play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter Bob
sleep — ” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. Bob
 Bob
Page | 298 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I Bob
said it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” Bob
 Bob
Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other Bob
at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, Bob
which seemed very cold and gloomy after the Bob
grounds. Bob
 Bob
“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid Bob
told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was Bob
either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it Bob
must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just Bob
hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us Bob
up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s Bob
office?” Bob
 Bob
They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign Bob
pointing them in the right direction. They had never Bob
been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know Bob
anyone who had been sent to see him. Bob
 Bob
“Well just have to — ” Harry began, but a voice Bob
suddenly rang across the hall. Bob
 Bob
“What are you three doing inside?” Bob
 Bob
It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of Bob
books. Bob
 Bob
“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Bob
Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. Bob
 Bob
“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall Bob
repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to Bob
want to do. “Why?” Bob
 Bob
Harry swallowed — now what? Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he Bob
hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils Bob
flared. Bob
 Bob
“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said Bob
coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry Bob
of Magic and flew off for London at once.” Bob
 Bob
“He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?” Bob
 Bob
“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, Bob
he has many demands on his time — ” Bob
 Bob
“But this is important.” Bob
 Bob
“Something you have to say is more important than Bob
the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” Bob
 Bob
“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, Bob
“Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone — ” Bob
 Bob
Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it Bob
wasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out Bob
of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. Bob
 Bob
“How do you know — ?” she spluttered. Bob
 Bob
“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that Bob
someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to Bob
talk to Professor Dumbledore.” Bob
 Bob
She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. Bob
 Bob
“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she Bob
said finally. “I don’t know how you found out about Bob
the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal Bob
it, it’s too well protected.” Bob
 Bob
“But Professor — ” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said Bob
shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen Bob
books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy Bob
the sunshine.” Bob
 Bob
But they didn’t. Bob
 Bob
“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor Bob
McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going Bob
through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out Bob
everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore Bob
out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Bob
Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns Bob
up.” Bob
 Bob
“But what can we — ” Bob
 Bob
Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. Bob
Snape was standing there. Bob
 Bob
“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly. Bob
 Bob
They stared at him. Bob
 Bob
“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, Bob
with an odd, twisted smile. Bob
 Bob
“We were — ” Harry began, without any idea what he Bob
was going to say. Bob
 Bob
“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging Bob
around like this, people will think you’re up to Bob
something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose Bob
any more points, can it?” Bob
 Bob
Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape Bob
called them back. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings Bob
and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Bob
 Bob
Good day to you.” Bob
 Bob
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Bob
 Bob
Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. Bob
 Bob
“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered Bob
urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape Bob
— wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he Bob
leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.” Bob
 Bob
“Why me?” Bob
 Bob
“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be Bob
waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a Bob
high voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I Bob
think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ’ ” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go Bob
and watch out for Snape. Bob
 Bob
“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Bob
Harry told Ron. “Come on.” Bob
 Bob
But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had Bob
they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest Bob
of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up Bob
again and this time, she lost her temper. Bob
 Bob
“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a Bob
pack of enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this Bob
nonsense! If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here Bob
again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Bob
 Bob
Yes, Weasley, from my own House!” Bob
 Bob
Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry Bob
had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Bob
Hermione came in. Bob
 Bob
“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and Bob
asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Bob
Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only Bob
just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.” Bob
 Bob
“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. Bob
 Bob
The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes Bob
were glittering. Bob
 Bob
“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and Bob
get to the Stone first.” Bob
 Bob
“You’re mad!” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall Bob
and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!” Bob
 Bob
“SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? Bob
If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming Bob
back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was Bob
trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to Bob
get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a Bob
school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter Bob
anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you Bob
and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Bob
Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, Bob
I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Bob
Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later Bob
than I would have, because I’m never going over to Bob
the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor Bob
tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Bob
Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” Bob
 Bob
He glared at them. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just Bob
lucky I got it back.” Bob
 Bob
“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
“All — all three of us?” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go Bob
alone?” Bob
 Bob
“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you Bob
think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go Bob
and look through my books, there might be Bob
something useful. ...” Bob
 Bob
“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” Bob
 Bob
“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick Bob
told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve Bob
percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out Bob
after that.” Bob
 Bob
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in Bob
the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of Bob
the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any Bob
more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been Bob
upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her Bob
notes, hoping to come across one of the Bob
enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry Bob
and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were Bob
thinking about what they were about to do. Bob
 Bob
Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. Bob
 Bob
“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan Bob
finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran Bob
upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the Bob
 Bob

 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had Bob
given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Bob
Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing. Bob
 Bob
He ran back down to the common room. Bob
 Bob
“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it Bob
covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet Bob
wandering along on its own — ” Bob
 Bob
“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of Bob
the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, Bob
clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d Bob
been making another bid for freedom. Bob
 Bob
“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly Bob
putting the cloak behind his back. Bob
 Bob
Neville stared at their guilty faces. Bob
 Bob
“You’re going out again,” he said. Bob
 Bob
“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t Bob
you go to bed, Neville?” Bob
 Bob
Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. Bob
They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape Bob
might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. Bob
 Bob
“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught Bob
again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” Bob
 Bob
“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is Bob
important.” Bob
 Bob
But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do Bob
something desperate. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in Bob
front of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!” Bob
 Bob
“Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and Bob
don’t be an idiot — ” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t Bob
think you should be breaking any more rules! And Bob
you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” Bob
 Bob
“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. Bob
 Bob
“Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” Bob
 Bob
He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the Bob
toad, who leapt out of sight. Bob
 Bob
“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his Bob
fists. “I’m ready!” Bob
 Bob
Harry turned to Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“Do something,” he said desperately. Bob
 Bob
Hermione stepped forward. Bob
 Bob
“Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” Bob
She raised her wand. Bob
 Bob
“Petrificus Totalusl” she cried, pointing it at Neville. Bob
 Bob
Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang Bob
together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he Bob
stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. Bob
 Bob
Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were Bob
jammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes Bob
were moving, looking at them in horror. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. Bob
“Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.” Bob
 Bob
“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they Bob
stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. Bob
 Bob
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t Bob
feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, Bob
every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant Bob
breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on Bob
them. Bob
 Bob
At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Bob
Norris skulking near the top. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Bob
Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they Bob
climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her Bob
lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything. Bob
 Bob
They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the Bob
staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing Bob
halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would Bob
trip. Bob
 Bob
“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed Bob
toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. Bob
“Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you Bob
ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” Bob
 Bob
He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at Bob
them. Bob

Harry had a sudden idea. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Bob
Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.” Bob
 Bob
Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught Bob
himself in time and hovered about a foot off the Bob
stairs. Bob
 Bob
“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said Bob
greasily. “My mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you Bob
— of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old Bob
Peevsie his little joke, sir.” Bob
 Bob
“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay Bob
away from this place tonight.” Bob
 Bob
“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up Bob
in the air again. “Hope your business goes well, Bob
 Bob
Baron, I’ll not bother you.” Bob
 Bob
And he scooted off. Bob
 Bob
“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron. Bob
 Bob
A few seconds later, they were there, outside the Bob
third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar. Bob
 Bob
“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s Bob
already got past Fluffy.” Bob
 Bob
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress Bob
upon all three of them what was facing them. Bob
Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. Bob
 Bob
“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. Bob
“You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.” Bob
 Bob
“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“We’re coming,” said Hermione. Bob
 Bob
Harry pushed the door open. Bob
 Bob
As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their Bob
ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their Bob
direction, even though it couldn’t see them. Bob
 Bob
“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered. Bob
 Bob
“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it Bob
there.” Bob
 Bob
“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Bob
Harry. “Well, here goes ...” Bob
 Bob
He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t Bob
really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes Bob
began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the Bob
dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell Bob
to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast Bob
asleep. Bob
 Bob
“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out Bob
of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They Bob
could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they Bob
approached the giant heads. Bob
 Bob
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, Bob
peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Bob
Hermione?” Bob
 Bob
“No, I don’t!” Bob
 Bob
“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully Bob
over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the Bob
trapdoor, which swung up and open. Bob
 Bob
“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing Bob
down, we’ll just have to drop.” Bob
 Bob
Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to Bob
get his attention and pointed at himself. Bob
 Bob
“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I Bob
don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Bob
Hermione so she can keep him asleep.” Bob
 Bob
Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ Bob
silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the Bob
moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its Bob
deep sleep. Bob
 Bob
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the Bob
trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. Bob
 Bob
He lowered himself through the hole until he was Bob
hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Bob
Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t Bob
follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Bob
Dumbledore, right?” Bob
 Bob
“Right,” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
“See you in a minute, I hope. ...” Bob
 Bob
And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as Bob
he fell down, down, down and — Bob
 Bob
FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he Bob
landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, Bob
his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he Bob
was sitting on some sort of plant. Bob
 Bob
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a Bob
postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a Bob
soft landing, you can jump!” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Bob
Harry. Bob
 Bob
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words. Bob
 Bob
“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here Bob
to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!” Bob
 Bob
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark Bob
from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She Bob
landed on Harry’s other side. Bob
 Bob
“We must be miles under the school,” she said. Bob
 Bob
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Lucky\” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!” Bob
 Bob
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She Bob
had to struggle because the moment she had landed, Bob
the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils Bob
around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs Bob
had already been bound tightly in long creepers Bob
without their noticing. Bob
 Bob
Hermione had managed to free herself before the Bob
plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in Bob
horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off Bob
them, but the more they strained against it, the Bob
tighter and faster the plant wound around them. Bob
 Bob
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what Bob
this is — it’s Devil’s Snare!” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a Bob
great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop Bob
the plant from curling around his neck. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Bob
Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, Bob
wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. Bob
 Bob
“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare ... what did Professor Bob
Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp — ” Bob
 Bob
“So light a fire!” Harry choked. Bob
 Bob
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione Bob
cried, wringing her hands. Bob
 Bob
“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A Bob
WITCH OR NOT?” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her Bob
wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of Bob
the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at Bob
the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it Bob
loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light Bob
and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself Bob
from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. Bob
 Bob
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” Bob
said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat Bob
off his face. Bob
 Bob
“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his Bob
head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” Bob
 Bob
“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone Bob
passageway, which was the only way forward. Bob
 Bob
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the Bob
gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The Bob
passageway sloped downward, and Harry was Bob
reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the Bob
 Bob

 Bob
heart, he remembered the dragons said to be Bob
guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a Bob
dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad Bob
enough ... Bob
 Bob
“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered. Bob
 Bob
Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to Bob
be coming from up ahead. Bob
 Bob
“Do you think it’s a ghost?” Bob
 Bob
“I don’t know ... sounds like wings to me.” Bob
 Bob
“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.” Bob
 Bob
They reached the end of the passageway and saw Bob
before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling Bob
arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel- Bob
bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the Bob
room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a Bob
heavy wooden door. Bob
 Bob
“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” Bob
said Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, Bob
but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . Bob
well, there’s no other choice ... I’ll run.” Bob
 Bob
He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, Bob
and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel Bob
sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, Bob
but nothing happened. He reached the door Bob
untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. Bob
 Bob
The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved Bob
at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Bob
Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm. Bob
 Bob
Page | 313 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Now what?” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“These birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,” Bob
said Hermione. Bob
 Bob
They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — Bob
glittering? Bob
 Bob
“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re Bob
keys\ Winged keys — look carefully. So that must Bob
mean ...” he looked around the chamber while the Bob
other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes — Bob
look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the Bob
door!” Bob
 Bob
“But there are hundreds of them!” Bob
 Bob
Ron examined the lock on the door. Bob
 Bob
“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably Bob
silver, like the handle.” Bob
 Bob
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the Bob
air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They Bob
grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted Bob
and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to Bob
catch one. Bob
 Bob
Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Bob
Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting Bob
things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving Bob
about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he Bob
noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it Bob
had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the Bob
keyhole. Bob
 Bob
“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — Bob
there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the Bob
feathers are all crumpled on one side.” Bob
 Bob
Page | 314 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was Bob
pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off Bob
his broom. Bob
 Bob
“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking Bob
his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “Ron, you Bob
come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and Bob
stop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it. Bob
Right, NOW!” Bob
 Bob
Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key Bob
dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped Bob
toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a Bob
nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone Bob
with one hand. Ron and Hermione ’s cheers echoed Bob
around the high chamber. Bob
 Bob
They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the Bob
key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock Bob
and turned — it worked. The moment the lock had Bob
clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very Bob
battered now that it had been caught twice. Bob
 Bob
“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the Bob
door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. Bob
 Bob
The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see Bob
anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light Bob
suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing Bob
sight. Bob
 Bob
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, Bob
behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than Bob
they were and carved from what looked like black Bob
stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were Bob
the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered Bob
slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. Bob
 Bob
“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our Bob
way across the room.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Behind the white pieces they could see another door. Bob
 Bob
“How?” said Hermione nervously. Bob
 Bob
“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be Bob
chessmen.” Bob
 Bob
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out Bob
to touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang Bob
to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight Bob
turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” Bob
 Bob
The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other Bob
two. Bob
 Bob
“This needs thinking about. ...” he said. “I suppose Bob
we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron Bob
think. Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or Bob
anything, but neither of you are that good at chess — Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us Bob
what to do.” Bob
 Bob
“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Bob
Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” Bob
 Bob
“What about you?” Bob
 Bob
“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron. Bob
 Bob
Page | 316 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because Bob
at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned Bob
their backs on the white pieces and walked off the Bob
board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, Bob
and Hermione took. Bob
 Bob
“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering Bob
across the board. “Yes ... look ...” Bob
 Bob
A white pawn had moved forward two squares. Bob
 Bob
Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved Bob
silently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were Bob
trembling. What if they lost? Bob
 Bob
“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.” Bob
 Bob
Their first real shock came when their other knight Bob
was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor Bob
and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite Bob
still, facedown. Bob
 Bob
“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. Bob
“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go Bob
on.” Bob
 Bob
Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces Bob
showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp Bob
black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only Bob
just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in Bob
danger. He himself darted around the board, taking Bob
almost as many white pieces as they had lost black Bob
ones. Bob
 Bob
“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me Bob
think — let me think ...” Bob
 Bob
The white queen turned her blank face toward him. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Yes ...” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way ... I’ve got Bob
to be taken.” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted. Bob
 Bob
“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make Bob
some sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me — Bob
that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!” Bob
 Bob
“But — ” Bob
 Bob
“Do you want to stop Snape or not?” Bob
 Bob
“Ron — ” Bob
 Bob
“Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the Bob
Stone!” Bob
 Bob
There was no alternative. Bob
 Bob
“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. Bob
“Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve Bob
won.” Bob
 Bob
He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. Bob
She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone Bob
arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione Bob
screamed but stayed on her square — the white Bob
queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d Bob
been knocked out. Bob
 Bob
Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. Bob
 Bob
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Bob
Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and Bob
bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last Bob
desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione Bob
charged through the door and up the next Bob
passageway. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“What if he’s — ?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince Bob
himself. “What do you reckon’s next?” Bob
 Bob
“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Bob
Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall Bob
transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that Bob
leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...” Bob
 Bob
They had reached another door. Bob
 Bob
“All right?” Harry whispered. Bob
 Bob
“Go on.” Bob
 Bob
Harry pushed it open. Bob
 Bob
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of Bob
them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes Bob
watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a Bob
troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out Bob
cold with a bloody lump on its head. Bob
 Bob
“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry Bob
whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its Bob
massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.” Bob
 Bob
He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly Bob
daring to look at what came next — but there was Bob
nothing very frightening in here, just a table with Bob
seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a Bob
line. Bob
 Bob
“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?” Bob
 Bob
They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a Bob
fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t Bob
ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same Bob
 Bob

instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading Bob
onward. They were trapped. Bob
 Bob
“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to Bob
the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Bob
 Bob
Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Bob
 Bob
Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, Bob
 Bob
One among us seven will let you move ahead, Bob
 Bob
Another will transport the drinker back instead, Bob
 Bob
Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Bob
 Bob
Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. Bob
 Bob
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, Bob
 Bob
To help you in your choice, we give you these clues Bob
four: Bob
 Bob
First, however slyly the poison tries to hide Bob
 Bob
You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Bob
 Bob
Second, different are those who stand at either end, Bob
 Bob
But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Bob
 Bob
Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Bob
 Bob
Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Bob
 Bob
Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Bob
 Bob
Are twins once you taste them, though different at first Bob
sight Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw Bob
that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like Bob
doing. Bob
 Bob
“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s Bob
logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t Bob
got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.” Bob
 Bob
“But so will we, won’t we?” Bob
 Bob
“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need Bob
is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; Bob
two are wine; one will get us safely through the black Bob
fire, and one will get us back through the purple.” Bob
 Bob
“But how do we know which to drink?” Bob
 Bob
“Give me a minute.” Bob
 Bob
Hermione read the paper several times. Then she Bob
walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to Bob
herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her Bob
hands. Bob
 Bob
“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us Bob
through the black fire — toward the Stone.” Bob
 Bob
Harry looked at the tiny bottle. Bob
 Bob
“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. Bob
“That’s hardly one swallow.” Bob
 Bob
They looked at each other. Bob
 Bob
“Which one will get you back through the purple Bob
flames?” Bob
 Bob
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end Bob
of the line. Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and Bob
get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, Bob
they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — Bob
go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Bob
Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Bob
Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, Bob
really.” Bob
 Bob
“But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with him?” Bob
 Bob
“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, Bob
pointing at his scar. “I might get lucky again.” Bob
 Bob
Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Bob
Harry and threw her arms around him. Bob
 Bob
“Hermionel” Bob
 Bob
“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.” Bob
 Bob
“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very Bob
embarrassed, as she let go of him. Bob
 Bob
“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There Bob
are more important things — friendship and bravery Bob
and — oh Harry — be carefull” Bob
 Bob
“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is Bob
which, aren’t you?” Bob
 Bob
“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from Bob
the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. Bob
 Bob
“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously. Bob
 Bob
“No — but it’s like ice.” Bob
 Bob
“Quick, go, before it wears off.” Bob
 Bob

“Good luck — take care — ” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“GO!” Bob
 Bob
Hermione turned and walked straight through the Bob
purple fire. Bob
 Bob
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest Bob
bottle. He turned to face the black flames. Bob
 Bob
“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle Bob
in one gulp. Bob
 Bob
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He Bob
put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced Bob
himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but Bob
couldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see Bob
nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other Bob
side, in the last chamber. Bob
 Bob
There was already someone there — but it wasn’t Bob
Snape. It wasn’t even Voldemort. Bob

THE MAN WITH TWO FACES Bob
 Bob
It was Quirrell. Bob
 Bob
“You\” gasped Harry. Bob
 Bob
Quirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all. Bob
 Bob
“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be Bob
meeting you here, Potter.” Bob
 Bob
“But I thought — Snape — ” Bob
 Bob
“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual Bob
quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Bob
Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to Bob
have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Bob
 Bob
Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- Bob
stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?” Bob
 Bob
Harry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it Bob
couldn’t. Bob
 Bob
“But Snape tried to kill me!” Bob
 Bob
Page | 324 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“No, no, no. / tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Bob
Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed Bob
to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She Bob
broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds Bob
and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed Bob
it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a Bob
countercurse, trying to save you.” Bob
 Bob
“Snape was trying to save me?” Bob
 Bob
“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think Bob
he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying Bob
to make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny, really ... he Bob
needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with Bob
Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Bob
Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he Bob
did make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of Bob
time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.” Bob
 Bob
Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin Bob
air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. Bob
 Bob
“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the Bob
school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d Bob
seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Bob
Stone.” Bob
 Bob
“ You let the troll in?” Bob
 Bob
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must Bob
have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back Bob
there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was Bob
running around looking for it, Snape, who already Bob
suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head Bob
me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to Bob
death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to Bob
bite Snape ’s leg off properly. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this Bob
interesting mirror.” Bob
 Bob
It was only then that Harry realized what was Bob
standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. Bob
 Bob
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell Bob
murmured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust Bob
Dumbledore to come up with something like this . . . Bob
but he’s in London ... I’ll be far away by the time he Bob
gets back. ...” Bob
 Bob
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell Bob
talking and stop him from concentrating on the Bob
mirror. Bob
 Bob
“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ” he blurted out. Bob
 Bob
“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to Bob
look at the back. “He was on to me by that time, Bob
trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected me all Bob
along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, Bob
when I had Lord Voldemort on my side. ...” Bob
 Bob
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and Bob
stared hungrily into it. Bob
 Bob
“I see the Stone ... I’m presenting it to my master ... Bob
but where is it?” Bob
 Bob
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but Bob
they didn’t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving Bob
his whole attention to the mirror. Bob
 Bob
“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. Bob
He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you Bob

know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted Bob
you dead.” Bob
 Bob
“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Bob
Snape was threatening you. Bob
 Bob
For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Bob
Quirrell’s face. Bob
 Bob
“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my Bob
master’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am Bob
weak — ” Bob
 Bob
“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Bob
Harry gasped. Bob
 Bob
“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I Bob
met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish Bob
young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about Bob
good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong Bob
I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, Bob
and those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have Bob
served him faithfully, although I have let him down Bob
many times. He has had to be very hard on me.” Bob
Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive Bob
mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from Bob
Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me Bob
. . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on Bob
me. ...” Bob
 Bob
Quirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering Bob
his trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so Bob
stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken Bob
hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. Bob
 Bob
Quirrell cursed under his breath. Bob
 Bob
“I don’t understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror? Bob
Should I break it?” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry’s mind was racing. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
What I want more than anything else in the world at Bob
the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Bob
Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see Bob
my self finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s Bob
hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing Bob
what I’m up to? Bob
 Bob
He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass Bob
without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his Bob
ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell Bob
ignored him. He was still talking to himself. Bob
 Bob
“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help Bob
me, Master!” Bob
 Bob
And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice Bob
seemed to come from Quirrell himself. Bob
 Bob
“Use the boy ... Use the boy ...” Bob
 Bob
Quirrell rounded on Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Yes — Potter — come here.” Bob
 Bob
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Bob
Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. Bob
 Bob
“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror Bob
and tell me what you see.” Bob
 Bob
Harry walked toward him. Bob
 Bob
I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie Bob
about what I see, that’s all. Bob
 Bob
Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in Bob
the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s Bob
 Bob

turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the Bob
mirror, and opened them again. Bob
 Bob
He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. Bob
But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It Bob
put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood- Bob
red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its Bob
pocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy Bob
drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly — Bob
he’d gotten the Stone. Bob
 Bob
“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?” Bob
Harry screwed up his courage. Bob
 Bob
“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he Bob
invented. “I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.” Bob
 Bob
Quirrell cursed again. Bob
 Bob
“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, Bob
he felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he Bob
make a break for it? Bob
 Bob
But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice Bob
spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips. Bob
 Bob
“He lies ... He lies ...” Bob
 Bob
“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me Bob
the truth! What did you just see?” Bob
 Bob
The high voice spoke again. Bob
 Bob
“Let me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...” Bob
 Bob
“Master, you are not strong enough!” Bob
 Bob
“I have strength enough ... for this. ...” Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the Bob
spot. He couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, he Bob
watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap Bob
his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Bob
Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. Bob
 Bob
Then he turned slowly on the spot. Bob
 Bob
Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a Bob
sound. Where there should have been a back to Bob
Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible Bob
face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with Bob
glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. Bob
 Bob
“Harry Potter ...” it whispered. Bob
 Bob
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs Bob
wouldn’t move. Bob
 Bob
“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere Bob
shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can Bob
share another’s body . . . but there have always been Bob
those willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ... Bob
Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks Bob
. . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the Bob
forest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be Bob
able to create a body of my own. ... Now ... why don’t Bob
you give me that Stone in your pocket?” Bob
 Bob
So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Bob
Harry’s legs. He stumbled backward. Bob
 Bob
“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your Bob
own life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as Bob
your parents. ... They died begging me for mercy. ...” Bob
 Bob
“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Bob
Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now Bob
smiling. Bob
 Bob
“How touching ...” it hissed. “I always value bravery. Bob
 Bob
... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your Bob
father first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but Bob
your mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to Bob
protect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you Bob
want her to have died in vain.” Bob
 Bob
“NEVER!” Bob
 Bob
Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort Bob
screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harry Bob
felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. At once, a Bob
needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his Bob
head felt as though it was about to split in two; he Bob
yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his Bob
surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head Bob
lessened — he looked around wildly to see where Bob
Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, Bob
looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his Bob
eyes. Bob
 Bob
“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, Bob
and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, Bob
landing on top of him, both hands around Harry’s Bob
neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with Bob
pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. Bob
 Bob
“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my Bob
hands!” Bob
 Bob
And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground Bob
with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, Bob
bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they Bob
looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Bob
Voldemort. Bob
 Bob
Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, Bob
but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Bob
Quirrell’s face — Bob
 Bob
“AAAARGH!” Bob
 Bob
Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and Bob
then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare Bob
skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only Bob
chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in Bob
enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. Bob
 Bob
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, Bob
and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed Bob
and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s Bob
head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only Bob
hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells Bob
of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Bob
Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!” Bob
 Bob
He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew Bob
all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... Bob
down ... Bob
 Bob
Something gold was glinting just above him. The Bob
Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too Bob
heavy. Bob
 Bob
He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of Bob
glasses. How strange. Bob
 Bob
He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Bob
Dumbledore swam into view above him. Bob
 Bob
“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore. Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Bob
Stone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick — Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the Bob
times,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Bob
Stone.” Bob
 Bob
“Then who does? Sir, I — ” Bob
 Bob
“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me Bob
thrown out.” Bob
 Bob
Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized Bob
he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed Bob
with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table Bob
piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. Bob
 Bob
“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Bob
Dumbledore, beaming. “What happened down in the Bob
dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a Bob
complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school Bob
knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Bob
Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a Bob
toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse Bob
you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be Bob
very hygienic, and confiscated it.” Bob
 Bob
“How long have I been in here?” Bob
 Bob
“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger Bob
will be most relieved you have come round, they have Bob
been extremely worried.” Bob
 Bob
“But sir, the Stone — ” Bob
 Bob
“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Bob
Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although Bob
you were doing very well on your own, I must say.” Bob
 Bob
“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?” Bob
 Bob
“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I Bob
reached London than it became clear to me that the Bob
place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived Bob
just in time to pull Quirrell off you — ” Bob
 Bob
“It was you.” Bob
 Bob
“I feared I might be too late.” Bob
 Bob
“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Bob
Stone much longer — ” Bob
 Bob
“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly Bob
killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid Bob
it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.” Bob
 Bob
“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — Bob
Nicolas Flamel — ” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, Bob
sounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing Bob
properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a Bob
little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” Bob
 Bob
“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?” Bob
 Bob
“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in Bob
order and then, yes, they will die.” Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Bob
Harry’s face. Bob
 Bob
“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, Bob
but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to Bob

bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well- Bob
organized mind, death is but the next great Bob
adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a Bob
wonderful thing. As much money and life as you Bob
could want! The two things most human beings would Bob
choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a Bob
knack of choosing precisely those things that are Bob
worst for them.” Bob
 Bob
Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed Bob
a little and smiled at the ceiling. Bob
 Bob
“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking ... Sir — even if Bob
the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ” Bob
 Bob
“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper Bob
name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the Bob
thing itself.” Bob
 Bob
“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of Bob
coming back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has Bob
he?” Bob
 Bob
“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there Bob
somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to Bob
share ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He Bob
left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his Bob
followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while Bob
you may only have delayed his return to power, it will Bob
merely take someone else who is prepared to fight Bob
what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is Bob
delayed again, and again, why, he may never return Bob
to power.” Bob
 Bob
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made Bob
his head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some Bob
other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me ... Bob
things I want to know the truth about. ...” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and Bob
terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with Bob
great caution. However, I shall answer your questions Bob
unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case Bob
I beg you 11 forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.” Bob
 Bob
“Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother Bob
because she tried to stop him from killing me. But Bob
why would he want to kill me in the first place?” Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. Bob
 Bob
“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Bob
 Bob
Not today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it Bob
from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . . Bob
I know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, Bob
you will know.” Bob
 Bob
And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. Bob
 Bob
“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?” Bob
 Bob
“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Bob
Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t Bob
realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you Bob
leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to Bob
have been loved so deeply, even though the person Bob
who loved us is gone, will give us some protection Bob
forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, Bob
greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, Bob
could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to Bob
touch a person marked by something so good.” Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out Bob
on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his Bob
eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Bob
Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know Bob
who sent it to me?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob

 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my Bob
possession, and I thought you might like it.” Bob
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things ... your Bob
father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens Bob
to steal food when he was here.” Bob
 Bob
“And there’s something else ...” Bob
 Bob
“Fire away.” Bob
 Bob
“Quirrell said Snape — ” Bob
 Bob
“Professor Snape, Harry.” Bob
 Bob
“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he Bob
hated my father. Is that true?” Bob
 Bob
“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike Bob
yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did Bob
something Snape could never forgive.” Bob
 Bob
“What?” Bob
 Bob
“He saved his life.” Bob
 Bob
“What?” Bob
 Bob
“Yes ...” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way Bob
people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape Bob
couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. ... I do Bob
believe he worked so hard to protect you this year Bob
because he felt that would make him and your father Bob
even. Then he could go back to hating your father’s Bob
memory in peace. ...” Bob
 Bob
Harry tried to understand this but it made his head Bob
pound, so he stopped. Bob
 Bob
“And sir, there’s one more thing ...” Bob
 Bob
Page | 337 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“Just the one?” Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?” Bob
 Bob
“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of Bob
my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, Bob
that’s saying something. You see, only one who Bob
wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — Bob
would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see Bob
themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My Bob
brain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough Bob
questions. I suggest you make a start on these Bob
sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was Bob
unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a Bob
vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve Bob
rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe Bob
with a nice toffee, don’t you?” Bob
 Bob
He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his Bob
mouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!” Bob
 Bob
Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but Bob
very strict. Bob
 Bob
“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded. Bob
 Bob
“Absolutely not.” Bob
 Bob
“You let Professor Dumbledore in. ...” Bob
 Bob
“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite Bob
different. You need rest.” Bob
 Bob
“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go Bob
on, Madam Pomfrey ...” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.” Bob
 Bob
And she let Ron and Hermione in. Bob

Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him Bob
again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his Bob
head was still very sore. Bob
 Bob
“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Bob
Dumbledore was so worried — ” Bob
 Bob
“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What Bob
really happened?” Bob
 Bob
It was one of those rare occasions when the true story Bob
is even more strange and exciting than the wild Bob
rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the Bob
mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione Bob
were a very good audience; they gasped in all the Bob
right places, and when Harry told them what was Bob
under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. Bob
 Bob
“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just Bob
going to die?” Bob
 Bob
“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — Bob
what was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is Bob
but the next great adventure.’ ” Bob
 Bob
“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, Bob
looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. Bob
 Bob
“So what happened to you two?” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Bob
Ron round — that took a while — and we were Bob
dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when Bob
we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — Bob
he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and Bob
hurtled off to the third floor.” Bob
 Bob
Page | 339 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
 Bob
“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. Bob
“Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” Bob
 Bob
“Well,” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say Bob
— that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” Bob
 Bob
“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny Bob
man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give Bob
me a chance. I think he knows more or less Bob
everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he Bob
had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and Bob
instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to Bob
help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find Bob
out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought Bob
I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. ...” Bob
 Bob
“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said Bob
Ron proudly. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end- Bob
of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Bob
Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Bob
Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Bob
Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” Bob
 Bob
At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. Bob
 Bob
“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she Bob
said firmly. Bob

After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to Bob

 Bob
“I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as Bob
she straightened his many candy boxes. “I can, can’t Bob
I?” Bob
 Bob

“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to Bob

Professor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts Bob
could be. “And you have another visitor.” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual Bob
when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be Bob
allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at Bob
him, and burst into tears. Bob
 Bob
“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his Bob
face in his hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past Bob
Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn’t Bob
know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All fer a Bob
dragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked Bob
out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” Bob
 Bob
“Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking Bob
with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into Bob
his beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, Bob
this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found Bob
out even if you hadn’t told him.” Bob
 Bob
“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the Bob
name!” Bob
 Bob
“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so Bob
shocked, he stopped crying. “I’ve met him and I’m Bob
calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we Bob
saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. Have a Bob
Chocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. ...” Bob
 Bob
Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and Bob
said, “That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.” Bob
 Bob
“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry Bob
anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. Bob

 Bob
“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter Bob
fix it. ’Course, he shoulda sacked me instead — Bob
anyway, got y eh this ...” Bob
 Bob
It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Bob
Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard Bob
photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every Bob
page were his mother and father. Bob
 Bob
“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, Bob
askin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh Bob
like it?” Bob
 Bob
Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood. Bob
 Bob
Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast Bob
alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Bob
Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one Bob
last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It Bob
was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and Bob
silver to celebrate Slytherin ’s winning the House Cup Bob
for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing Bob
the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the Bob
High Table. Bob
 Bob
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and Bob
then everybody started talking loudly at once. He Bob
slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Bob
Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that Bob
people were standing up to look at him. Bob
 Bob
Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The Bob
babble died away. Bob
 Bob
“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. Bob
 Bob
“And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing Bob
waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious Bob
feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads Bob
are all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the Bob

whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty Bob
before next year starts. ... Bob
 Bob
“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs Bob
awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Bob
Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in Bob
third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Bob
Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Bob
Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” Bob
 Bob
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Bob
Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging Bob
his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. Bob
 Bob
“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. Bob
“However, recent events must be taken into account.” Bob
 Bob
The room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded Bob
a little. Bob
 Bob
“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute Bob
points to dish out. Let me see. Yes ... Bob
 Bob
“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...” Bob
 Bob
Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish Bob
with a bad sunburn. Bob
 Bob
"... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has Bob
seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty Bob
points.” Bob
 Bob
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; Bob
the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be Bob
heard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you Bob
know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s Bob
giant chess set!” Bob
 Bob
At last there was silence again. Bob

“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of Bob

Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly Bob
suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up Bob
and down the table were beside themselves — they Bob
were a hundred points up. Bob
 Bob
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore. Bob
 Bob
The room went deadly quiet. "... for pure nerve and Bob
outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty Bob
points.” Bob
 Bob
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while Bob
yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now Bob
had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly Bob
the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House Bob
Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one Bob
more point. Bob
 Bob
Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell Bob
silent. Bob
 Bob
“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, Bob
smiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up Bob
to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our Bob
friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Bob
Longbottom.” Bob
 Bob
Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well Bob
have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, Bob
so loud was the noise that erupted from the Bob
Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up Bob
to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, Bob
disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He Bob
had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor Bob
before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs Bob
and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more Bob

stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Bob
Curse put on him. Bob
 Bob
“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of Bob
applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were Bob
celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little Bob
change of decoration.” Bob
 Bob
He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green Bob
hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; Bob
the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Bob
Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Bob
Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced Bob
smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once Bob
that Snape ’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one Bob
jot. This didn’t worry Harry. It seemed as though life Bob
would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it Bob
ever was at Hogwarts. Bob
 Bob
It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than Bob
winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out Bob
mountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight. Bob
 Bob
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results Bob
were still to come, but come they did. To their great Bob
surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Bob
Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first Bob
years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Bob
Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions Bob
one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as Bob
stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he Bob
had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you Bob
couldn’t have everything in life. Bob
 Bob
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their Bob
trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking Bob
in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all Bob
students, warning them not to use magic over the Bob
holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us Bob

these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to Bob
take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across Bob
the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; Bob
talking and laughing as the countryside became Bob
greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Bob
Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off Bob
their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; Bob
pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at Bob
King’s Cross station. Bob
 Bob
It took quite a while for them all to get off the Bob
platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket Bob
barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and Bob
threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting Bob
out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. Bob
 Bob
“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, Bob
“both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” Bob
 Bob
“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look Bob
forward to.” Bob
 Bob
People jostled them as they moved forward toward the Bob
gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them Bob
called: Bob
 Bob
“Bye, Harry!” Bob
 Bob
“See you, Potter!” Bob
 Bob
“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him. Bob
 Bob
“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry. Bob
 Bob
He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway Bob
together. Bob
 Bob
“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!” Bob

It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she Bob
wasn’t pointing at Ron. Bob
 Bob
“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see Bob
“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” Bob
 Bob
Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them. Bob
 Bob
“Busy year?” she said. Bob
 Bob
“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the Bob
sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” Bob
 Bob
“Oh, it was nothing, dear.” Bob
 Bob
“Ready, are you?” Bob
 Bob
It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still Bob
mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, Bob
carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary Bob
people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, Bob
looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. Bob
 Bob
“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley. Bob
 Bob
“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry Bob
up, boy, we haven’t got all day.” He walked away. Bob
 Bob
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Bob
Hermione. Bob
 Bob
“See you over the summer, then.” Bob
 Bob
“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said Bob
Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, Bob
shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. Bob

“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at Bob
the grin that was spreading over his face. “ They don’t Bob
know we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m Bob
going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...” Bob
